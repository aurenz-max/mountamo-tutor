# Proactive Weekly Learning Planner - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 1 & Phase 2 of the Proactive Weekly Learning Planner PRD. The system now generates week-long learning roadmaps using LLM-based planning, and the daily planner intelligently pulls from these weekly plans using adaptive logic.

---

## ✅ Completed Components

### Phase 1: Backend Scaffolding & Shadow Mode

#### 1.1 ✅ Weekly Plan Data Model
**File:** [`backend/app/models/weekly_plan.py`](backend/app/models/weekly_plan.py)
- Created complete `WeeklyPlan` Pydantic model with:
  - `PlannedActivity` model with status (pending/assigned/completed/skipped)
  - Activity metadata: `activity_uid`, `subskill_id`, `planned_day` (0-4 for Mon-Fri)
  - LLM reasoning, priority levels, curriculum metadata
  - Helper methods: `get_activities_for_day()`, `get_catch_up_activities()`, `get_accelerate_activities()`
- Enums for `ActivityStatus`, `ActivityPriority`, `ActivityType`
- Request/response models for API endpoints

#### 1.2 ✅ Cosmos DB Integration
**File:** [`backend/app/db/cosmos_db.py`](backend/app/db/cosmos_db.py)
- Added `weekly_plans` container with partition key `/student_id`
- Implemented CRUD methods:
  - `save_weekly_plan()` - Save generated plans
  - `get_weekly_plan()` - Retrieve by student_id and week_start_date
  - `get_current_weekly_plan()` - Get current week's plan
  - `update_activity_status_in_weekly_plan()` - Update activity status (pending → assigned → completed)
  - `delete_weekly_plan()` - For regeneration testing
  - `add_parent_star_to_activity()` - Phase 3 parent interaction

#### 1.3 ✅ Weekly Planner Service
**File:** [`backend/app/services/weekly_planner.py`](backend/app/services/weekly_planner.py)
- Implemented `WeeklyPlannerService` with:
  - `generate_weekly_plan()` - Orchestrates full generation
  - `_fetch_student_analytics_snapshot()` - Gets velocity metrics + available subskills from BigQuery
  - `_call_llm_for_weekly_planning()` - Structured Gemini LLM call with JSON schema
  - `_calculate_subject_allocations()` - Applies PRD velocity rules:
    - velocity < 70% → 3 activities
    - velocity < 85% → 2 activities
    - velocity ≥ 85% → 1 activity
  - `_build_weekly_planning_prompt()` - Comprehensive LLM prompt with:
    - Week structure (Monday-Friday)
    - Subject allocations based on velocity
    - Available subskills from BigQuery
    - Activity distribution guidance

#### 1.4 ✅ API Endpoints (Shadow Mode)
**File:** [`backend/app/api/endpoints/weekly_planner.py`](backend/app/api/endpoints/weekly_planner.py)
- Implemented endpoints:
  - `POST /api/weekly-planner/generate/{student_id}` - Generate weekly plan
  - `GET /api/weekly-planner/{student_id}/current` - Get current week's plan
  - `GET /api/weekly-planner/{student_id}/week/{week_start_date}` - Get specific week
  - `GET /api/weekly-planner/{student_id}/status` - Progress summary
  - `GET /api/weekly-planner/{student_id}/day/{day_index}` - Activities for specific day
  - `POST /api/weekly-planner/{student_id}/activity/{activity_uid}/complete` - Mark complete
  - `DELETE /api/weekly-planner/{student_id}/week/{week_start_date}` - Delete plan
  - `GET /api/weekly-planner/health` - Health check
- Registered in [`backend/app/main.py`](backend/app/main.py) under `/api/weekly-planner`

---

### Phase 2: Daily Activities Service Refactoring (The "Pull" System)

#### 2.1 ✅ Adaptive Daily Plan Generation
**File:** [`backend/app/services/daily_activities.py`](backend/app/services/daily_activities.py)
- Refactored `_generate_fresh_daily_plan()` to:
  1. **FIRST:** Try to pull from weekly plan (if exists)
  2. **FALLBACK:** Use AI daily recommendations
  3. **FINAL FALLBACK:** Use BigQuery or static activities

- New method: `_try_pull_from_weekly_plan()`:
  - Implements adaptive "pull" logic:
    - **CATCH-UP:** Pull pending/assigned activities from previous days (up to 3)
    - **TODAY'S SCHEDULED:** Pull pending activities where `planned_day == current_day`
    - **ACCELERATE:** If student ahead and room remains, pull 1-2 activities from future days
  - Updates activity statuses from `pending` → `assigned`
  - Returns activities in `DailyActivity` format

- New helper methods:
  - `_convert_planned_activities_to_daily()` - Converts `PlannedActivity` → `DailyActivity`
  - `_determine_activity_type_from_planned()` - Extracts activity type
  - `_calculate_points_from_planned()` - Calculates points based on priority

#### 2.2 ✅ Activity Completion Integration
**File:** [`backend/app/api/endpoints/daily_activities.py`](backend/app/api/endpoints/daily_activities.py)
- Enhanced `hydrate_plan_completion()` to:
  1. Update daily plan completion (existing logic)
  2. **NEW:** If activity came from weekly plan (ID starts with "weekly-"):
     - Extract `activity_uid`
     - Update weekly plan status: `assigned` → `completed`
     - Enables adaptive logic to track student progress

## 🔄 System Flow

### Weekly Plan Generation Flow
```
1. Admin/Cron triggers: POST /api/weekly-planner/generate/{student_id}
2. WeeklyPlannerService.generate_weekly_plan()
   ├─ Fetch student analytics from BigQuery (velocity metrics, available subskills)
   ├─ Calculate subject allocations based on velocity
   ├─ Call Gemini LLM with structured JSON schema
   │  └─ Prompt includes: velocity data, available subskills, weekly structure
   ├─ LLM returns 20-25 activities distributed Mon-Fri
   └─ Save to Cosmos DB weekly_plans container
```

### Daily Plan Assembly Flow (NEW)
```
1. Student requests: GET /api/daily-activities/daily-plan/{student_id}
2. DailyActivitiesService.get_or_generate_daily_plan()
   ├─ Check Cosmos DB for existing daily plan (retrieval-first)
   └─ If not found → _generate_fresh_daily_plan()
      ├─ NEW: _try_pull_from_weekly_plan()
      │  ├─ Get current week's WeeklyPlan from Cosmos DB
      │  ├─ Apply adaptive logic:
      │  │  ├─ CATCH-UP: Pull activities from previous days (pending/assigned)
      │  │  ├─ SCHEDULED: Pull activities for today (pending)
      │  │  └─ ACCELERATE: Pull future activities if ahead
      │  ├─ Convert PlannedActivity → DailyActivity
      │  └─ Update statuses: pending → assigned
      └─ If no weekly plan → fallback to AI daily recommendations
```

### Activity Completion Flow (NEW)
```
1. Student completes activity: POST /api/daily-activities/daily-plan/{student_id}/activities/{activity_id}/complete
2. Background task: hydrate_plan_completion()
   ├─ Update daily plan: mark activity as complete
   └─ NEW: If activity_id starts with "weekly-"
      ├─ Extract activity_uid
      ├─ Calculate current week's Monday
      └─ Update weekly plan: assigned → completed
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Weekly Plan Generation
```bash
# 1. Generate a weekly plan for student 1234
POST /api/weekly-planner/generate/1234
{
  "week_start_date": "2025-01-27",  # Next Monday
  "target_activities": 20,
  "force_regenerate": false
}

# 2. Check generated plan
GET /api/weekly-planner/1234/current

# 3. Check specific day's activities
GET /api/weekly-planner/1234/day/0  # Monday
```

### Test Daily Plan Assembly
```bash
# 1. Request daily plan (should pull from weekly plan)
GET /api/daily-activities/daily-plan/1234

# Response should have:
# - personalization_source: "weekly_plan"
# - activities with IDs starting with "weekly-"

# 2. Complete an activity
POST /api/daily-activities/daily-plan/1234/activities/weekly-ACT-Mathematics-0-1/complete

# 3. Check weekly plan status (activity should be "completed")
GET /api/weekly-planner/1234/status
```

### Test Adaptive Logic
```bash
# Day 1 (Monday):
GET /api/daily-activities/daily-plan/1234
# Should pull: Monday's scheduled activities

# Complete all Monday activities, then Day 2 (Tuesday):
GET /api/daily-activities/daily-plan/1234
# Should pull: Tuesday's scheduled + any incomplete Monday activities

# Complete everything and get ahead:
GET /api/daily-activities/daily-plan/1234
# Should pull: Today's + ACCELERATE (pull from Wednesday)
```

   - LLM token usage
   - Generation time
   - Cost per plan

2. **Daily Plan Assembly:**
   - % using weekly plan vs fallback

   - Average response time

3. **Student Engagement:**
   - Activity completion rates (weekly plan vs AI daily)
   - Weekly plan completion %
   - Days ahead/behind

4. **Cost Analysis:**
   - LLM costs before/after (target: 70% reduction)
   - API latency before/after (target: 4x improvement)
