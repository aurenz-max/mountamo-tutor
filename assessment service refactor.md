# Architectural Refactor Guide: Assessment Service

## 1. Goal: Decoupling and Maintainability

**Current Problem:** The existing `AssessmentService` and its Cosmos DB data model are tightly coupled. The `score_assessment` function has complex, branching logic that simultaneously processes submissions, aggregates results, and formats final outputs. This makes the system brittle and difficult to modify; adding a new feature like `skill_analysis` requires touching many parts of a monolithic process.

**Objective:** Refactor the service to create a clean, maintainable, and testable workflow. We will separate the *processing* of raw data from the *building* of the final report.

## 2. Core Principles: The "Mise en Place" Kitchen

We will adopt a new architectural pattern for our scoring logic, inspired by how professional kitchens work ("Mise en Place" - everything in its place).

1.  **Prep First (Transformation):** We will first process *all* raw problem submissions into a single, clean, standardized list of intermediate objects. This is the "prep work."
2.  **Then Assemble (Building):** With all the prep work done, separate, specialized functions ("builders") will use this clean list to construct each part of the final report (the summary, the skill analysis, the AI insights).
3.  **Orchestrate:** The main `score_assessment` function will become a simple **Orchestrator**, managing this two-step flow instead of doing all the work itself.

## 3. Part 1: The New Cosmos DB Data Model

The assessment document will now clearly separate the **definition** from the **results**. The final `results` object will be the single source of truth for the UI.

**Action:** Update the persistence logic to store the assessment document in this new shape upon completion.

```json
{
  "id": "assess_1004_Arts_1758754598",
  "assessment_id": "assess_1004_Arts_1758754598",
  "student_id": 1004,
  "subject": "Arts",
  "document_type": "assessment",

  // --- STATE & METADATA ---
  "status": "completed", // "generated", "in_progress", "completed"
  "created_at": "2025-09-24T18:56:38.589Z",
  "started_at": "2025-09-24T18:56:42.019Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-09-24T18:57:33.734Z",

  // --- ASSESSMENT DEFINITION (Immutable) ---
  "blueprint": { ... },
  "problems": [ ... ],
  
  // --- STUDENT SUBMISSION DATA ---
  "student_answers": {
    "mc_001": { "selected_option_id": "mc_001_option_c" },
    "tf_001": { "selected_answer": true },
    "fib_001": null 
  },

  // --- CANONICAL RESULTS (The single source of truth for reports) ---
  // This entire object is generated ONCE during scoring.
  "results": {
    "summary": {
      "correct_count": 7,
      "total_questions": 10,
      "score_percentage": 70.0
    },
    "ai_insights": {
      "summary": "...",
      "performance_quote": "..."
    },
    "skill_analysis": [
      {
        "skill_id": "Creating-I",
        "skill_name": "Draw a self-portrait...",
        "category": "weak_spots",
        "total_questions": 5,
        "correct_count": 4,
        "percentage": 80
      }
    ],
    "problem_reviews": [
      {
        "problem_id": "mc_001",
        "is_correct": true,
        "student_answer_text": "Red",
        "correct_answer_text": "Red"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**Key Change:** The large, messy `batch_submission` object will **no longer be stored** in the database. It becomes an ephemeral object used during the scoring process only.

## 4. Part 2: The Code Refactor

### Step A: Define the Key Decoupling Object

This is the lynchpin of the new design. It's the "prep bowl" that standardizes the output of our processing loop.

**Action:** Create a new dataclass or TypedDict for `ProcessedReview`.

```python
# In a suitable schemas file or within assessment_service.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, Any

@dataclass
class ProcessedReview:
    """A clean, standardized representation of a single problem's result."""
    problem_id: str
    subskill_id: str
    is_correct: bool
    score: int
    student_answer_text: str
    correct_answer_text: str
    full_review_payload: Dict[str, Any] # The rich payload from SubmissionService
    problem_content: Dict[str, Any]     # The original problem definition
```

### Step B: Refactor `score_assessment` into an Orchestrator

**Action:** Rewrite the `score_assessment` method to follow the new, clean workflow.

```python
# In assessment_service.py

from typing import List

async def score_assessment(self, assessment_id: str, student_id: int, answers: Dict[str, Any], ...):
    """Orchestrates the scoring of an assessment."""
    
    # 1. SETUP: Fetch the assessment definition
    assessment = await self.get_assessment(assessment_id, student_id, ...)
    problems = assessment.get("problems", [])
    
    # 2. PREP WORK (Transformation): Create the "Mise en Place"
    # This loop's ONLY job is to convert raw submissions into our clean intermediate format.
    processed_reviews: List[ProcessedReview] = []
    for problem in problems:
        review = await self._process_single_problem(
            problem, 
            answers.get(str(problem.get("id")))
        )
        processed_reviews.append(review)

    # 3. ASSEMBLY (Building): Delegate to specialized, independent functions.
    summary_data = self._build_summary(processed_reviews)
    
    skill_analysis_data = self._build_skill_analysis(
        processed_reviews=processed_reviews, 
        blueprint=assessment.get("blueprint", {})
    )
    
    problem_reviews_data = self._build_problem_reviews(processed_reviews)
    
    ai_insights_data = await self.ai_assessment.generate_enhanced_assessment_summary(
        blueprint=assessment.get("blueprint", {}),
        submission_result=summary_data,
        review_items_data=[pr.full_review_payload for pr in processed_reviews]
    )

    # 4. FINAL ASSEMBLY: Combine the built parts into the final results object.
    final_results = {
        "summary": summary_data,
        "skill_analysis": skill_analysis_data,
        "problem_reviews": problem_reviews_data,
        "ai_insights": ai_insights_data
    }

    # 5. PERSISTENCE: Update the assessment document in Cosmos DB.
    # This will involve a new or updated method in your CosmosDBService.
    await self.cosmos.update_assessment_with_results(
        assessment_id, 
        student_id, 
        final_results, 
        answers
    )

    # 6. RETURN: Return a user-friendly summary.
    return {"assessment_id": assessment_id, **summary_data}
```

### Step C: Create the Helper and Builder Functions

**Action:** Create the following new private methods within `AssessmentService`. Each one is small, focused, and testable.

```python
# In assessment_service.py

# --- The Prep Worker ---
async def _process_single_problem(self, problem: Dict, student_answer: Any) -> ProcessedReview:
    """
    Handles the messy logic of calling the SubmissionService for one problem 
    and returns a clean, standardized ProcessedReview object.
    """
    # Contains all the existing logic for handling answered vs. unanswered questions,
    # calling submission_service.handle_submission, and creating fallbacks.
    # ...
    # Its final job is to return a ProcessedReview instance.
    return ProcessedReview(...)

# --- The Builders ---
def _build_summary(self, processed_reviews: List[ProcessedReview]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Calculates and returns the top-level summary stats."""
    # ... logic to calculate correct_count, total_questions, etc. ...
    return {...}

def _build_skill_analysis(self, processed_reviews: List[ProcessedReview], blueprint: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Aggregates performance by subskill_id and formats the skill_analysis array.
    This function is now simple and completely decoupled.
    """
    skill_performance = {} # key: subskill_id
    
    # 1. Aggregate performance from the processed reviews list
    for review in processed_reviews:
        # ... logic to populate skill_performance dict ...
    
    # 2. Format the final output list using metadata from the blueprint
    # ...
    return skill_analysis_list

def _build_problem_reviews(self, processed_reviews: List[ProcessedReview]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Formats the final, lean problem_reviews array for the UI."""
    return [
        {
            "problem_id": review.problem_id,
            "is_correct": review.is_correct,
            # ... and other fields needed for the report
        }
        for review in processed_reviews
    ]

```

## 5. Implementation Plan

1.  **Define the Schema:** Add the `ProcessedReview` dataclass.
2.  **Create Builder Skeletons:** Create the new private methods (`_process_single_problem`, `_build_summary`, `_build_skill_analysis`, `_build_problem_reviews`) with `pass` in their bodies.
3.  **Refactor `score_assessment`:** Rewrite the main `score_assessment` function to be the orchestrator as shown above. It will call the (currently empty) builder functions.
4.  **Implement the Prep Worker:** Move the logic for handling a single problem from the old `score_assessment` loop into `_process_single_problem`.
5.  **Implement the Builders:** Move the aggregation and formatting logic from the old `score_assessment` function into their respective builder functions (`_build_summary`, `_build_skill_analysis`, etc.).
6.  **Update Persistence:** Modify the `CosmosDBService` to handle the new `update_assessment_with_results` call, which will set the `status` to `completed` and write the entire `results` object.
7.  **Simplify `get_assessment_summary`:** This function will become much simpler. It will just fetch the document and return the `results` object if the status is `completed`. All on-the-fly mapping logic should be removed.
8.  **Test:** Write unit tests for each builder function. This is now possible because they are small, pure functions with clear inputs and outputs.

By following this plan, we will create a robust and flexible system that is easy to understand, test, and extend in the future.

  🎯 What We're Trying to Accomplish

  We are implementing a complete architectural refactor of the Assessment Service based on the "Mise en
  Place" kitchen philosophy to address critical maintainability and coupling issues.

  Current Problems

  - Monolithic score_assessment method: 255+ lines of tightly coupled logic
  - Complex branching: Simultaneous processing, aggregation, and formatting
  - Brittle design: Adding new features like skill_analysis requires touching many parts
  - Poor testability: Cannot unit test individual components in isolation
  - Data model coupling: Assessment service tightly coupled to Cosmos DB structure

  Target Architecture: "Mise en Place" Pattern

  1. Prep First (Transformation): Process ALL raw submissions into clean, standardized ProcessedReview
  objects
  2. Then Assemble (Building): Specialized builder functions construct each report section independently     

  3. Orchestrate: Main method becomes a simple coordinator managing the two-step flow

  ✅ What Has Been Built

  1. Core Data Structure

  @dataclass
  class ProcessedReview:
      """Clean, standardized representation of a single problem's result"""
      problem_id: str
      subskill_id: str
      is_correct: bool
      score: int
      student_answer_text: str
      correct_answer_text: str
      full_review_payload: Dict[str, Any]  # Rich SubmissionService data
      problem_content: Dict[str, Any]      # Original problem definition

      # Essential metadata for downstream builders
      skill_id: str
      skill_description: str
      subskill_description: str
      unit_id: str
      unit_title: str
      subject: str

  2. Refactored Orchestrator Method

  File: assessment_service.py:998-1072

  The new score_assessment method follows the clean orchestration pattern:
  async def score_assessment(...):
      # 1. SETUP: Fetch assessment definition
      # 2. PREP WORK: Convert all problems to ProcessedReview objects
      # 3. ASSEMBLY: Delegate to specialized builders
      # 4. FINAL ASSEMBLY: Combine into results object
      # 5. PERSISTENCE: Update Cosmos DB with new structure
      # 6. RETURN: User-friendly summary

  3. Comprehensive Prep Worker

  File: assessment_service.py:732-877

  The _process_single_problem method handles:
  - ✅ Universal validator integration via SubmissionService (no duplicate logic)
  - ✅ Comprehensive logging with [ASSESSMENT_SERVICE] prefixes for debugging
  - ✅ Rich metadata extraction (skill descriptions, unit info, subject)
  - ✅ Clean error handling for both answered and unanswered questions
  - ✅ Standardized output format as ProcessedReview objects

  4. Builder Function Skeletons

  File: assessment_service.py:879-892

  Created empty builder functions ready for implementation:
  - _build_summary(processed_reviews) → Summary stats
  - _build_skill_analysis(processed_reviews, blueprint) → Skill performance analysis
  - _build_problem_reviews(processed_reviews) → UI-friendly problem reviews

  5. Support Infrastructure

  - ✅ Helper method: _extract_correct_answer_text() with comprehensive logging
  - ✅ Import structure: Added dataclass import for ProcessedReview
  - ✅ Documentation: Clear docstrings explaining the new architecture

  🚧 What Still Needs to Be Done

  Priority 1: Implement Builder Functions

  A. _build_summary Builder

  def _build_summary(self, processed_reviews: List[ProcessedReview]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
      """Calculate top-level summary statistics"""
      # TODO: Implement
      # - correct_count = sum(pr.is_correct for pr in processed_reviews)
      # - total_questions = len(processed_reviews)
      # - score_percentage = (correct_count / total_questions) * 100
      # Return: {"correct_count": X, "total_questions": Y, "score_percentage": Z}

  B. _build_skill_analysis Builder

  def _build_skill_analysis(self, processed_reviews: List[ProcessedReview], blueprint: Dict) ->
  List[Dict]:
      """Aggregate performance by skill and format for skill_analysis array"""
      # TODO: Implement
      # - Group by skill_id/subskill_id using the rich metadata
      # - Calculate per-skill statistics
      # - Categorize as "weak_spots", "strong_areas", etc.
      # - Use skill_description, unit_title for rich display names
      # Return: [{"skill_id": X, "skill_name": Y, "category": Z, "percentage": W}, ...]

  C. _build_problem_reviews Builder

  def _build_problem_reviews(self, processed_reviews: List[ProcessedReview]) -> List[Dict]:
      """Format lean problem_reviews array for UI consumption"""
      # TODO: Implement
      # - Extract key fields: problem_id, is_correct, student_answer_text, correct_answer_text
      # - Include essential metadata for display
      # Return: [{"problem_id": X, "is_correct": Y, "student_answer_text": Z}, ...]

  Priority 2: Update Cosmos DB Integration

  New Persistence Method

  # In CosmosDBService - NEW METHOD NEEDED
  async def update_assessment_with_results(
      assessment_id: str,
      student_id: int,
      final_results: Dict[str, Any],
      answers: Dict[str, Any],
      time_taken_minutes: Optional[int],
      firebase_uid: Optional[str]
  ) -> bool:
      """Update assessment with new results structure and set status to 'completed'"""
      # TODO: Implement
      # - Fetch existing assessment
      # - Add final_results to document
      # - Set status = "completed"
      # - Store answers and timing
      # - Update completed_at timestamp

  Target Document Structure

  {
    "id": "assess_1004_Arts_1758754598",
    "status": "completed",
    "created_at": "...",
    "completed_at": "...",
    "blueprint": {...},
    "problems": [...],
    "student_answers": {"mc_001": {...}},

    "results": {
      "summary": {"correct_count": 7, "total_questions": 10, "score_percentage": 70.0},
      "ai_insights": {"summary": "...", "performance_quote": "..."},
      "skill_analysis": [{"skill_id": "Creating-I", "category": "weak_spots", ...}],
      "problem_reviews": [{"problem_id": "mc_001", "is_correct": true, ...}]
    }
  }

  Priority 3: Simplify get_assessment_summary

  Current: Complex on-the-fly processing and mappingTarget: Simple document fetch and return results
  object

  async def get_assessment_summary(...):
      """Simplified - just fetch and return results object"""
      # TODO: Replace existing complex logic with:
      # 1. Fetch assessment document
      # 2. Return assessment["results"] if status == "completed"
      # 3. Minimal error handling

  Priority 4: Testing & Validation

  Unit Tests Needed

  - Test ProcessedReview creation with various problem types
  - Test each builder function independently with mock data
  - Test orchestrator flow with integration scenarios
  - Test error handling for malformed problems/answers

  Integration Testing

  - End-to-end assessment scoring with real problem data
  - Cosmos DB persistence validation with new structure
  - AI service integration with new results format

  🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

  Key Dependencies

  - SubmissionService: Already integrated with universal validator (no changes needed)
  - AIAssessmentService: May need updates to work with new results structure
  - CosmosDBService: Needs new update_assessment_with_results method

  Logging Strategy

  All methods use [ASSESSMENT_SERVICE] prefix for easy log filtering:
  logger.info(f"[ASSESSMENT_SERVICE] Processing problem {problem_id}")
  logger.debug(f"[ASSESSMENT_SERVICE] Metadata - Skill: {skill_id} ({skill_description})")

  Error Handling Philosophy

  - Graceful degradation: Individual problem failures don't crash entire assessment
  - Rich error context: Log problem_id, student_id, and error details
  - Fallback values: Provide sensible defaults for missing metadata

  🎯 Success Criteria

  When complete, the refactored system will provide:

  1. 🧪 Testability: Each builder function can be unit tested independently
  2. 🔧 Maintainability: Adding new report sections requires only a new builder function
  3. 📊 Rich Metadata: All skill analysis has access to descriptions, unit info, and categorization
  4. 🚀 Performance: Clean separation allows for future optimization/caching
  5. 🔍 Debuggability: Comprehensive logging for production troubleshooting
