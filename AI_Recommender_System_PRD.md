# AI-Powered Learning Recommender System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Enhance the existing tutoring platform's recommender system with an AI-powered engine that leverages hierarchical student performance metrics, curriculum relationships, and learning science principles to provide personalized, contextual recommendations for optimal learning progression.

## Problem Statement

The current recommender system uses basic competency-weighted selection and decision trees but lacks:
- Contextual understanding of student's learning patterns and preferences
- Analysis of hierarchical skill relationships and dependencies  
- Adaptive difficulty progression based on learning velocity
- Personalized learning path optimization
- Integration of real-time performance trends

## Solution Overview

Build an AI-enhanced recommender system that:
1. **Analyzes hierarchical performance data** from the existing analytics dashboard
2. **Uses LLM reasoning** to understand skill relationships and learning patterns
3. **Provides contextual recommendations** with detailed rationale
4. **Adapts in real-time** based on student performance and engagement
