/**
 * generationContext.ts — the ONE typed contract every generator receives.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 * -----------------------
 * `ManifestItem.config` is an untyped bag (`{ [key: string]: unknown }`), so each
 * of the ~100 generators invented its own way to read what the manifest sends, and
 * the registry boundary grew ~5 different config-shaping idioms (see the
 * 2026-06-27 intent audit / PRD_GENERATION_CONTEXT_HARMONIZATION.md). The result is
 * 100+ independently-developed copies of the same plumbing — intent threading,
 * scope resolution, eval-mode constraint, support tiers — each subtly different.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT
 * ------------
 * `GenerationContext` is a single typed envelope, resolved ONCE at the registry
 * boundary by `resolveGenerationContext` and consumed uniformly by every
 * context-native generator. Every cross-cutting axis becomes a field here, resolved
 * in exactly one place. A handler can no longer "forget" to thread intent because
 * handlers no longer shape config — the pipeline does.
 *
 * SCOPE OF THIS PHASE (Phase 0)
 * -----------------------------
 * The universally-resolvable axes are fully centralized here: lesson framing,
 * intent/objective, pedagogical `scope`, and the normalized `supportTier`.
 * Eval-mode and structural-difficulty resolution still need per-primitive metadata
 * (the primitive's `ChallengeTypeDoc` registry, its support/structural lever
 * tables), so for now the context carries the eval-mode *input* (`targetEvalMode`)
 * and the generator resolves the constraint with its own docs. Lifting that
 * metadata into per-primitive descriptors so the pipeline can resolve those axes
 * too is PRD Phase 1.
