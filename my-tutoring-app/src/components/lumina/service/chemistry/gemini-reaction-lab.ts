GRADE BAND REQUIREMENTS (${gradeBand}):
${gradeBandDescriptions[gradeBand]}

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Choose a REAL, safe experiment that students could actually perform (or safely simulate virtually).
2. Include 2-4 substances with accurate physical descriptions (state, color, amount).
3. The reaction must have at least 2 observable signs of change.
4. Always include a realWorldConnection — explain where this reaction happens in everyday life.
5. Provide 3-5 challenges sequenced by difficulty:
   - Start with a "predict" challenge (what do you think will happen?)
   - Middle challenges: "observe", "identify_signs", or "classify"
   - End with harder challenges: "explain", "balance", or "conservation"
6. Every narration field should be wonder-driven (e.g. "Amazing! You just witnessed a chemical reaction — the same kind that makes bread rise!").
7. Animation effects should match the actual reaction (e.g. acid-base → bubbles + foam, oxidation → colorShift).
8. Temperature change should be realistic (e.g. exothermic reactions: +5 to +30°C, endothermic: -5 to -20°C).
9. Safety level must be accurate: most kitchen chemistry is "safe", anything with heat or fumes is "caution" or "supervised".
10. Set showOptions appropriately:
    - showParticleView: false for K-2, true for 3-5 and 6-8
    - showEquation: false for K-2 and 3-5, true for 6-8
    - showSafetyBadge: always true
    - showTemperatureGauge: true if the reaction has a temperature change
    - showObservationNotebook: always true
    - showConservationCounter: false for K-2 and 3-5, true for 6-8
11. Notebook prompts should guide structured scientific thinking:
    - predictPrompt: Wonder-filled question about what might happen
    - predictionOptions: ALWAYS provide 3-4 multiple-choice prediction options. One correct, others plausible but wrong.
      Example: [{id:"A", text:"Bubbles will form and overflow"}, {id:"B", text:"The color will change to green"}, {id:"C", text:"Nothing will happen"}, {id:"D", text:"It will get very cold"}].
      Set correctPredictionId to the correct option id (e.g. "A").
    - observePrompts: 2-4 specific observation questions (sight, sound, temperature, smell)
    - explainPrompt: Age-appropriate "why did this happen?" question
12. For K-2: formula fields should be null. equation should be null.
    For 3-5: formula fields are optional. equation is optional.
    For 6-8: formula and equation fields are required.

CHALLENGE SCAFFOLDING (IMPORTANT):
Use the right answer format for each challenge type:
- predict: Provide "options" with 3-4 multiple-choice predictions of what will happen.
  Example: [{id:"A", text:"Bubbles will form and it will fizz"}, {id:"B", text:"The color will change to blue"}, {id:"C", text:"Nothing will happen"}, {id:"D", text:"It will explode"}].
  Set correctOptionId to the correct option id. Still set targetAnswer for fallback.
- observe: Provide "options" with 3-4 choices about what was observed.
  Example: [{id:"A", text:"The mixture turned cloudy and warm"}, {id:"B", text:"Bubbles formed and it fizzed"}, {id:"C", text:"Nothing happened"}].
  Set correctOptionId to the correct option id.
- explain: Provide "options" with 3-4 explanations of why the reaction happened.
  Example: [{id:"A", text:"The acid broke apart the baking soda molecules"}, {id:"B", text:"The water dissolved the powder"}, {id:"C", text:"The heat melted the substances"}].
  Set correctOptionId to the correct option id.
- classify: No options needed (the UI has built-in Chemical Change / Physical Change buttons). Set targetAnswer to "chemical" or "physical".
- balance: Provide "options" with 3-4 equation choices (only one is correctly balanced).
  Example: [{id:"A", text:"2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O"}, {id:"B", text:"H₂ + O₂ → H₂O"}, {id:"C", text:"2H₂ + 2O₂ → 2H₂O"}].
  Set correctOptionId to the correct option id.
- identify_signs: Provide "options" with 3-4 sets of signs, only one list is fully correct.
  Example: [{id:"A", text:"Fizzing and temperature change"}, {id:"B", text:"Color change and new smell"}, {id:"C", text:"No observable changes"}].
  Set correctOptionId to the correct option id.
- conservation: Set "isTrueFalse" to true and "correctBoolean" to the correct answer (true/false).
  Frame the instruction as a true/false statement (e.g. "The total mass of products equals the total mass of reactants.").`;
