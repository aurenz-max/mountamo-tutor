# Direct Instruction — Primitive Family Backlog

Working queue for the DI primitive family. Top = next. Graduated 2026-07-20 from
`qa/HANDOFF-di-bench-2026-07-16.md` per its own gate ("graduate to a BACKLOG file
if the bench passes") — the bench passed: open-mic run, probe run, hook-parity
run, engine-gate run all PASS (`qa/di-bench/run-2026-07-*.md`). User call
2026-07-20: DI becomes a **new primitive family** alongside core/math/literacy,
first set custom-made.

## Architecture (settled — do not re-litigate per item)

The engine stack is committed and runtime-verified; primitives are CONTENT PACKS
over it:

- `hooks/voiceTurnMachine.ts` + `hooks/useLiveVoiceTurns.ts` — open-mic turn
  authority (DI-2 dual barge-in threshold). Generic.
- `hooks/judgedLoopModel.ts` + `hooks/useJudgedSpeechLoop.ts` — live-judged
  call-response loop (voice-anchored attempts DI-1, arming DI-3,
  sentence-scoped sentinel verdicts, resync). Generic; sentinels parameterized.
- The Live tutor judges the AUDIO in-band per the cue's judging contract; the
  sentinel scan only reads which branch it took. Word-matching is the reporting
  channel, not the judge (proven: /s/ affirmed from audio over a "Shh." ASR).
- Bench (`di-bench` home card 🎯) stays the modality's measurement harness —
  every new response class benches there BEFORE a primitive wires it.

**"Custom-made" means:** cue scripts, judging contracts, sentinels, and
progression policy are HAND-AUTHORED per primitive (exact wording is the
pedagogy — DISTAR discipline). Item CONTENT is generator-scoped per objective:
curated speakable/picturable item menus injected into the prompt, attachments
made in code (rhyme-studio K pattern; scope-context contract). No
`DEFAULT_ITEMS`-style hardcoded content ships in a primitive.

**Registration:** new `primitives/direct-instruction/` family dir + new
`service/manifest/catalog/di.ts` catalog section. Entry through the normal
manifest/lesson path — catalog entries + eval modes, NO new launch surface
(lesson-entry principle). Response time captured silently; no visible timers.

## Standing gates (every DI primitive)

1. **Bench-first per response class:** a new class of expected spoken response
   (number words, blends, sight words…) gets a ~30-min bench sitting with a
   hand-rolled item list before any primitive wiring. Letter NAMES remain
   BLOCKED (LetterSpotter homophone ruling — needs a Voice Studio bench first).
2. **Sentinel-collision check:** the script contract ("never begin any other
   sentence with <affirm>/<correct>") must be re-verified per domain script —
   pick collision-free openers where the domain phrasing fights it (math tutors
   want to say "Yes!"). Engine sentinels are configurable per pack.
3. **Correction-opener directive:** the tutoring block must remind that EVERY
   correction begins with the correct sentinel (engine-gate run: model dropped
   "My turn:" on a re-correction).
4. Standard lifecycle: `/primitive` L0 birth + `/curriculum-fit` (every mode
   needs a curriculum home) + `/eval-test`; `/tutor-test` probe for the
   directive block. Open-mic doctrine holds: no force-mutes from the primitive.

## Queue

1. **FAMILY-WIDE: the wrong answer's CONTENT is discarded** *(found 2026-07-25
   answering the user's "so you won't see an incorrect in the logs?" — executor:
   `/primitive` follow-up or a dedicated slice; all three packs, engine-adjacent
   but component-owned).* A miss IS recorded — `outcomes[]` carries
   `{correct, attempts, score}` and metrics carry `attemptsCount` /
   `firstTryCount` / `overallAccuracy`, so a wrong-then-right lands as
   `attempts: 2, score: 67` and a capped miss as `correct: false, score: 0`.
   **But WHAT the child said is thrown away.** The engine emits
   `attempt-transcript` with `text` (the heard answer); every DI component keeps
   only `emission.responseMs` and drops the text on the floor. So we can see
   THAT a child missed `5 - 1` twice, never that they said "four" both times —
   an off-by-one that is a textbook diagnosable misconception. This is exactly
   the input `project_misconception-loop` wants, and DI is the family best
   positioned to produce it (the tutor already judged the audio). Fix shape:
   accumulate per-attempt `{text, judgment}` into the outcome and ship it in the
   evaluation payload's non-metric bag. Check the misconception loop's identity
   ruling (primitive_type + declared scope) before choosing the field name.
2. ~~**DI sentence reading — 4th pack.**~~ **BORN L0 2026-07-25 — STRUCK, see Done.**
   *(Kept below: the sitting's rulings, which are now the pack's design record and
   the input to its ladder. Standing gate 1 PASSED 2026-07-25, user mic sitting,
   "this worked so well!".)* 10/10 items, 10 affirmed / 3 corrected / **0
   off-script / 0 unanchored**. Report:
   `qa/di-bench/run-2026-07-25-sentence-reading-probe.md`.
   **What the sitting settled — carry ALL of it into `/primitive`:**
   - **(a) One-word errors ARE detectable: 2/2.** Deliberate OMISSIONS ("big"
     from a 6-word sentence, "red" from a 7-word) were both caught and
     corrected, both retries affirmed. Omission is the hardest class to hear —
     nothing wrong is said, something merely isn't. The pack is viable.
   - **(b) Whole-sentence correction is SETTLED — do not re-litigate.** The
     learner self-repaired the missing word on the FIRST retry both times.
     Word-targeted correction would buy nothing and costs the off-script risk of
     making the tutor fill a variable the script can't know.
   - **(c) Keep the restating affirm.** ~2-3s against a ~15-17s item cycle whose
     dominant term is learner think-time (8-11s). Tutor talk is not the
     bottleneck for connected text; the child reading is.
   - **SHIP-BLOCKING, cheap: `silenceCloseMs` must be raised for sentences.**
     Three "attempt superseded" events — a child reading connected text PAUSES
     mid-sentence, and the 500ms close (tuned for one-word answers) splits one
     read into two voice turns. It broke the alias cross-check (both alias
     disagreements in the run trace to this, NOT judge error) and nulled
     `responseMs` on second fragments. Pass ~1100ms via
     `useJudgedSpeechLoop({ voice: { config: { silenceCloseMs } } })`. **Do NOT
     change the family default** — 500ms is right for the three short-response
     packs.
   - **Scope: 3-8 words, no ceiling found.** The 8-word item read clean first
     try. Longer text is unbenched — don't let a generator exceed 8 until it is.
   - **Residual → HUMAN-CHECKS #53:** both deliberate errors landed on the 6-
     and 7-word items, so the SHORT end is unstressed, and item 1 ("The cat
     sat.") transcribed as "the car" yet affirmed — ASR artifact or false
     affirm, unresolved. A short sentence gives the judge less context to notice
     a swap, so it may be HARDER than the long ones.
   - Minor, family-wide: the opening turn added an unscripted greeting before
     the scripted "Listen:". `offScript: 0` didn't catch it (that counter
     classifies verdicts, not fidelity). Almost certainly present in all three
     shipped packs. Not a blocker.
   *(superseded — kept for the reasoning trail)* **PROBE WIRED 2026-07-25.** *(user call 2026-07-25:
   "can we turn read-aloud-studio into a DI-style primitive?" — yes, but as a
   FORK, see the ruling below.)*
   **Ruling — fork, do NOT convert `read-aloud-studio`.** It is a live catalog
   entry with 3 eval modes (`accuracy` β2.0 / `expression` β3.5 / `dialogue`
   β4.5), `supportsEvaluation: true`, and a row in the backend
   `problem_type_registry.py` — so the manifest can route to it today.
   Rewriting its modality in place would silently change what those three eval
   modes MEAN and invalidate their β calibration: the contract-first
   fork-on-conflict case. Instead, `di-sentence-reading` takes judged
   short-sentence accuracy at G1-2, and read-aloud-studio keeps the territory
   where self-assessment is defensible — longer passages, WPM tracking,
   expression/dialogue practice for older readers. Two primitives, one honest
   boundary; revisit read-aloud-studio's LOWER band only after the pack ships.
   **Probe now live in the bench** (`Sentence reading`, 10 items,
   `kind: 'sentence'`): length ladder 3→8 words, vocabulary carried from the
   word-reading probe so a failure is attributable to connected text rather
   than new words; one-word-error stress built in (hen/pen, hat/hut, had/has,
   and a repeated "we go" phrase where an omission is easy to produce). The
   sentence branch gets its OWN judging criteria — the generic "reasonably
   close for a kindergartener" is right for one short production and WRONG for
   connected text, where "close" rubber-stamps exactly the dropped/swapped word
   that reading fluency exists to catch. Verified: bench tests 22/22, tsc 0
   Lumina errors. **The sitting decides three things** (all named in the
   `SENTENCE_READING_PROBE_ITEMS` docblock): (a) can Live detect a ONE-WORD
   error inside a 5-8 word utterance — make-or-break; (b) does the safe
   whole-sentence correction hold, or does the pack need word-targeted
   correction and the off-script risk that carries; (c) does the restating
   affirm drag at sentence length.
   **Original framing, still the why:** `read-aloud-studio` already owns G1-6 fluency and its own
   catalog says **"Student self-assessment only, no AI speech grading" /
   "No AI grading of speech"** — it has a mic, records, tracks WPM, and judges
   nothing. A child cannot self-assess reading accuracy, so that primitive
   produces no real evidence for the IRT model. Converting connected-text
   fluency to a judged DI pack is the rung directly above di-word-reading
   (sound → word → sentence) and matches `feedback_production-modality-roadmap`.
   **Gated by standing gate 1:** connected text is a NEW response class — all
   three existing packs judge a SHORT response (one sound, one word, one number
   word), and judging a multi-word utterance brings partial credit,
   self-corrections, and pace. Needs its own ~30-min bench sitting before any
   wiring. Do NOT skip the bench because the mechanism looks familiar — the
   probe being wired is NOT the gate; the sitting is.

*(the ladder — still the default pull ahead of new births; empty of births as of
2026-07-24 — the first custom-made set is fully born: three packs at
L0+. Next pulls come from the LADDER, not new births: each pack's birth-cert
follow-up queue (`qa/eval-reports/di-{letter-sounds,word-reading,math-facts}-birth.md`)
— nearest rungs: **di-math-facts `/add-support-tiers` (L3)** — its L1
`/add-eval-modes` and L2 `/add-tutoring-scaffold` both landed (see Done), and
the L3 fade is already specified on the birth cert (easy = model+guide+test,
medium = model+test, hard = test-only, as a cue variant per tier, NOT a UI
flag) — di-letter-sounds `/add-support-tiers` (L3), di-word-reading catalog
`tutoring:` move (L2). A fourth pack proposal (blends once benched) is a user
phase call, not a queue default. NOTE: a "counting sequence" pack is no longer
the obvious fourth — di-math-facts absorbed the next-number step as its
`counting_next` eval mode.)*

## Watch-items (from the engine-gate run)
- Resync + no-verdict timeout are unit-covered but not yet observed live —
  first primitive's live runs should try to trigger both.
- Echo blip class: floors readout margin was ~6× in the hook-parity run; keep
  the floors readout available in primitive dev builds.

## Done
- **Contrastive correction — di-sentence-reading + di-math-facts (2026-07-25, user
  ruling; MVP scope, audio only).** The first live correction run in ANY DI pack
  (#54 sitting) overturned the sentence pack's bench finding (b): a reader read
  "Mom got THE pot" for "Mom got a pot" **three times** against an identical
  whole-sentence re-model. A re-model asks the learner to diff it against their
  memory of what they just said — they never learn WHICH word was wrong. The
  bench's evidence for (b) was n=2 and both were OMISSIONS the learner
  self-repaired on the first retry; a SUBSTITUTION with no self-repair was never
  observed. **User ruling: name the error and contrast it, verbally only — no
  screen change.**
  **The sitting's stated blocker did not survive inspection.** It called
  word-targeting "a direct threat to the sentinel discipline"; sentinel
  classification matches **OPENERS only** (`matchesOpener`, `judgedLoopModel.ts`),
  so a mid-line slot cannot reach it. The residual risk is "speak exactly"
  fidelity alone — which is what #55 measures.
  **Shape (both packs, one pattern):** `correctionLine` survives **byte-for-byte**
  as the fallback for a miss with nothing to contrast (silence / unintelligible /
  no number), and a new `contrastCorrectionLine` is preferred whenever the miss is
  localisable — `My turn: not ⟨what they said⟩ — <correct form> Your turn. <ask>`.
  `⟨…⟩` is a slot the tutor fills from the audio it already judged (it heard the
  error; it is not inferring anything new). Opener unchanged, so zero engine
  change. Ends on the CORRECT form (recency) before re-eliciting, keeping standing
  gate 3. The judging contract now routes three ways (contrast / fallback /
  affirm), forbids drifting to a third wording on a repeat miss, and tells the
  tutor never to speak the ⟨ ⟩ marks. Math also carries the **echo misconception**
  the user named — answering "2 + 1" with "one", the last number heard — in the
  contract and as a 5th catalog `commonStruggle`.
  Verified: `typecheck:lumina` **0**; full vitest **964/964**; new
  `diCorrectionContrast.test.ts` **15/15** pinning the load-bearing invariant —
  both packs' contrast lines, **filled and unfilled**, still `scanForSentinel` →
  `corrected`, exactly one slot each, and the bench-proven fallbacks byte-identical.
  **UNBENCHED — the family rule is "do not re-word without a new sitting"
  → HUMAN-CHECKS #55, which rides the same mic run as #54/#50(a).** The same
  whole-sentence re-model is still in di-letter-sounds and di-word-reading; port
  it there only after #55 confirms the fidelity risk is acceptable.
- **di-sentence-reading L3 support tiers (2026-07-25, birth-cert follow-up #3
  struck) — the pack reached L0→L1→L2→L3 on its birth day.** The pack fits NONE
  of the skill's six archetypes (live-judged spoken production, where the Live
  tutor IS the interaction surface) and has **zero `showOptions`**, so the whole
  ladder is modality #2 instruction-as-scaffold — the AngleWorkshop case. The
  sub-steps were already there: **DISTAR's model→guide→test IS a scaffold
  ladder.** easy = model+guide+test (the L0 shape) / medium = model+test (choral
  "Together" withdrawn) / hard = **cold read** ("Your turn. Read it." — the child
  decodes print never having heard it). Lives in the SCRIPT (`leadInFor`) as the
  birth cert specified, never a UI flag.
  **`hard` closes the answer-leak caveat the birth audit could not resolve:** the
  model line speaks the sentence before the child reads, which is legitimate DI
  instruction but leaves an ECHO ROUTE open; at hard the sentence never enters
  the block the tutor may speak, so no echo route survives.
  NEVER withdrawn at any tier: the printed sentence (the manipulable object), the
  correction's re-model (standing gate 3 — remediation is not scaffolding), the
  restating affirm (bench question (c)), and the judging contract (or tiers stop
  being comparable evidence).
  **Tutor second-channel hole found + fixed** (the tier gotcha, in this pack's
  idiom): L2's `scaffoldingLevels` level 1 said "Read the sentence once more,
  slowly" — at hard that reads aloud the very sentence the tier withheld. Fixed
  three ways: level 1 reworded (levels 2-3 safe, they are post-attempt), a
  per-item `coldReadGuard` in the cue, and `supportTier` added as a contextKey +
  threaded through connect and `updateContext`.
  **Deliberate departure:** NO `tierSection` injected into the generator prompt.
  Under Fork A the model's only job is picking sentence ids, so a tier line could
  only nudge it toward different SENTENCES = tier→content leakage, i.e.
  structural difficulty by the back door. The tier is 100% code-composed.
  Verified: typecheck:lumina 0; full tsc 0 Lumina-surface; vitest **949/949**
  (89 files); new suite `diSentenceReadingScript.support-tiers.test.ts` 13/13
  with **non-vacuity proven** (5 fail when the tier logic is reverted, incl. the
  key "hard NEVER puts the sentence in the spoken block"). **A bad assertion of
  mine was caught and corrected in QA:** diffing generated content across
  easy/med/hard to prove "a tier never changes the numbers" CANNOT work — a
  same-tier control returned three different sets, so the call itself is
  nondeterministic; the rule is established structurally instead. That control
  also **retires the L0 report's convergent-selection note** — L1's selection
  path introduced real run-to-run variety. Report:
  `qa/eval-reports/di-sentence-reading-support-tiers-2026-07-25.md`.
  Ladder next = `/add-structural-difficulty` (L4, now unblocked; axis =
  sentence LENGTH, already carried as `wordCount`/`meanSentenceWords` — and the
  8-word benched ceiling is NOT a difficulty knob).
- **di-sentence-reading L2 tutoring scaffold (2026-07-25, birth-cert follow-up
  #2 struck) — the pack reached L0 → live → L1 → live → L2 in a single day.**
  The pack is the family's exception: it already shipped its catalog `tutoring:`
  block AT BIRTH (di-letter-sounds' L2 slice had built the family lesson-mode
  wiring, so putting it there cost nothing and made lesson mode work day one).
  L2 therefore added precisely what birth left out: `contextKeys`
  (challengeType/text/wordCount/sentences), the **`{{challengeType}}` placeholder
  those keys make safe** (an unfilled `{{key}}` renders SILENTLY, so it could not
  ship before its key), 5 `commonStruggles` describing behaviour actually
  observed in the bench sitting + two live runs, a generator `sentences` flat
  summary (RUNTIME STATE populated from the first auth-time prompt), and a
  component `updateContext` effect (silent channel — never perturbs the judged
  loop). Bench-proven `aiDirectives` + cue lines + judging contract untouched,
  byte for byte; sentinel discipline re-checked on all new copy.
  **Sibling difference recorded:** di-math-facts deliberately keeps its ANSWER
  out of RUNTIME STATE; that reasoning does NOT transfer here, because the
  printed sentence is stimulus and target both — the tutor must have it to model
  it and the child is already looking at it. No key is withheld.
  Verified: typecheck:lumina 0; vitest 936/936; `/tutor-test` **0 HIGH** — 2
  WARNs that are the DI family's SHAPE (`data-bag-unparsed`: DI connects via
  `ctx.connect`/`updateContext`, not a parseable `useLuminaAI` bag;
  `no-sendtext-moments`: DI cues ride `[DI_ITEM]`/`[DI_MOVE_ON]`/`[DI_COMPLETE]`
  so the tutor structurally cannot go silent) — the identical pair both siblings
  carry. Tier-2 probe on THREE modes: `probe.findings: []` every run, all four
  keys real and mode-correct, and the `sentences` summary tracks the pinned
  mode's pool (proof L1 and L2 did not drift). The 5 `(not set)` strings in the
  response are confined to `staticPromptPreview`, which by construction has no
  generated content — verified by walking every string field.
  **Tier 3 rides HUMAN-CHECKS #54** (no new gate): three of the five struggles
  only fire on a MISS, so #54's deliberately-wrong read exercises them. Watch
  the named risk — 5 struggles could loosen a scripted tutor into chattiness
  (di-math-facts cleared this with 4). Report:
  `qa/tutor-reports/di-sentence-reading-2026-07-25.md`.
  Ladder next = `/add-support-tiers` (L3).
- **di-sentence-reading L1 eval-modes (2026-07-25, birth-cert follow-up #1
  struck) — the pack went L0 → live-verified → L1 in ONE day.** Full 4-mode
  ladder: `decodable_sentence` (β2.5, every content word sound-it-out — blending
  transferred to connected text) / `read_sentence` (β3.0, L0 unchanged) /
  `sentence_review` (β3.5, cumulative wide mix) / `sight_phrase_sentence` (β4.0,
  irregular high-frequency density — whole-word recall). **Standing gate 1
  satisfied with NO new bench sitting** (every mode is the same response class),
  and — unlike di-math-facts, which needed one type-aware line — this ladder
  shipped with **ZERO new spoken copy**: the L0 script was already phrased around
  `it.text`, so all four skills read through the bench-proven sentences byte for
  byte. What a mode changes is the POOL. **These are identities, not tiers:**
  `decodable_sentence` and `read_sentence` have different curriculum homes at
  different grades, and `decodable_sentence` gives the pack the **K home** the
  birth fit probe abstained on. Verified: typecheck:lumina 0; full tsc 0
  Lumina-surface errors; vitest 936/936; backend β rows mirror the catalog;
  real-Gemini eval-test **10/10 clean** with per-mode **POOL** assertions (not
  just type stamps — all four modes render identically, so the route's own
  validator passes trivially): sight mode serves only sight-heavy, decodable
  never serves an un-blendable sentence, decodable+short-a stays vowel-pure,
  sight correctly IGNORES the vowel scope, **mixed yields all four types**
  (SP-21). `/topic-trace` closed the routing path the tester structurally cannot
  reach (it always pins): a sight-word objective → `sight_phrase_sentence`
  end-to-end, **newly live** (with one mode the resolver short-circuited).
  **Found + fixed in QA: `sentence_review` never broadened past the focus** — a
  short-a review returned 4/4 short-a, i.e. the base mode relabelled, because
  the model's picks (drawn from the focused prompt menu) crowded out the wide
  pool. This is di-math-facts' `fact_review` bug in MIRROR IMAGE — theirs drew
  zero focus items and lost the thread; this drew nothing else and lost the
  breadth. Review now stops at its ≤2 anchors, back-fills shuffled from the whole
  menu, and rotates by vowel even under a pinned scope. Deferred by design: a
  longer-text rung (leaves the benched scope) and pace/expression
  (read-aloud-studio's territory; L0 judging refuses to judge speed). Report:
  `qa/eval-reports/di-sentence-reading-evalmodes-2026-07-25.md` + trace
  `qa/topic-traces/reading-sentences-with-sight-words-2026-07-25.md`.
  **L1 VERIFIED LIVE same day (user mic run on `sight_phrase_sentence`, "these
  are so good!") — HUMAN-CHECKS #54(c) struck.** 4/4 affirmed, all four sentences
  from the sight-heavy pool: the mode means at runtime what the catalog says, and
  the bench-proven cue lines carried a vocabulary (see/go/you/my/and) that no
  prior sitting had spoken — the last plausible place for the ladder to have
  disturbed proven speech. Post-affirmation reward emoji confirmed rendering.
  Ladder next = `/add-tutoring-scaffold` (L2 — note the tutoring block is
  already in the catalog, so L2's real work is contextKeys + commonStruggles +
  the RUNTIME STATE sync).
- **di-sentence-reading L0 LIVE GATE CLOSED (2026-07-25, user mic run — "it
  worked fantastically!") — born and runtime-verified the SAME DAY.** 4/4
  affirmed (The rat ran. / I see a pig. / The red hen ran. / The dog is hot.),
  session completed and submitted, recap all-emerald. Closes three things at
  once: the judged loop end-to-end through THIS component (its `applyVerdict` →
  `recordResult` → `advance` path and cue builders had never run with a real
  mic), **the reward beat at SENTENCE length** (the named pacing risk — the
  affirm restates the whole sentence, ~2-3s, well past what the 900ms/3.5s beat
  was tuned against; not flagged as dragging or clipping), and the one-sentence
  stage invariant. **Residuals, both quantitative → HUMAN-CHECKS #54:** (a) the
  `silenceCloseMs: 1100` fix has no numeric proof yet — the run did not visibly
  break, but 0-supersessions / non-null `responseMs` / `aliasMatch` live in the
  `[DI eval]` console payload, not the UI; (b) the SHORT end (#53) and the
  correction branch stayed dark — **fourth consecutive all-correct DI sitting**,
  and `[DI_MOVE_ON]` has still never fired in any pack (note the difference from
  math-facts: the sentence correction WORDING is bench-proven, 3 corrections
  incl. 2 deliberate omissions; it is the COMPONENT's retry/cap path that is
  untested). Report: `qa/eval-reports/di-sentence-reading-live-2026-07-25.md`.
- **#2 di-sentence-reading — BORN L0 (2026-07-25). Fourth DI pack, and the
  family's first CONNECTED TEXT pack.** Separate content pack over the committed
  engine; sibling packs byte-untouched, NO `hooks/` change.
  `DiSentenceReading.tsx` + hand-authored `diSentenceReadingScript.ts` (every
  spoken line **byte-for-byte** the bench's proven `kind:'sentence'` branch) +
  `gemini-di-sentence-reading.ts` (Fork A: 37-sentence code-owned decodable menu,
  Gemini enum-selects ids + wrapper only; vocabulary carried from the
  word-reading menu so a miss is attributable to connected text, not new words) +
  full registration (catalog `read_sentence` β3.0 + `audioInput` + the L0
  `tutoring:` block, `registerContextGenerator`, metrics union, primitiveRegistry,
  ComponentId, backend `problem_type_registry`, tester **Sentence Reading**
  picker + a per-pack `defaultGrade` so the tester stops sending kindergarten for
  every pack).
  **The ship-blocking bench finding landed in the same slice:** `silenceCloseMs`
  **1100ms** pack-level (a mid-sentence pause is part of one response); the
  family default stays 500ms for the three short-response packs.
  **All three sitting rulings honoured:** whole-sentence correction (no
  word-targeting), restating affirm kept, 3-8 word scope code-capped with a final
  filter after every other rule.
  Verified: `typecheck:lumina` **0**; full tsc **0 Lumina-surface errors** (805
  pre-existing, all in the legacy graveyard); vitest **936/936**; real-Gemini
  eval-test **PASS ×11** with every check programmatic (wordCount recomputed from
  text, benched ceiling, sentinel safety, wrapper leak, teaching order, vowel
  purity) — `qa/eval-reports/di-sentence-reading-2026-07-25.md`; curriculum-fit
  **MATCH ×2** (G1 `LA003-01` Oral Reading Accuracy 0.824 — whose top subskill
  *"self-correct reading miscues by re-reading"* is a near-verbatim statement of
  the judging contract; G2 `LA001-05` Reading Fluency 0.807, whose sibling
  subskills are read-aloud-studio's self-assessment territory — independent
  confirmation of the fork ruling) —
  `qa/curriculum-fit/di-sentence-reading-2026-07-25.md`. EVAL_TRACKER row added
  (362/379).
  **Found + fixed during QA:** phonics scope was vowel OVERLAP, not purity — a
  "short a" objective was being served "Sam has a red cup." (a/e/u). The pool now
  prefers sentences whose vowels are a SUBSET of the scope and widens only if
  pure cannot fill the session; all five vowels now serve pure sets.
  **One departure worth knowing:** the tutoring block ships in the CATALOG at
  birth (not the script, as the two older reading packs did) because
  di-letter-sounds' L2 slice already built the family lesson-mode wiring that
  resolves both connect paths from there — so lesson mode works on day one. L2
  still owns `contextKeys` / `commonStruggles` / the RUNTIME STATE sync.
  Birth cert + 6-layer queue: `qa/eval-reports/di-sentence-reading-birth.md`.
  **L0 gate NOT closed — the live loop has never been driven → HUMAN-CHECKS #54**,
  which carries five named stresses, headed by the `silenceCloseMs` fix's own
  proof (0 attempt-supersessions + non-null `responseMs` + `aliasMatch` true) and
  the unresolved SHORT-end residual #53.
- **di-math-facts L0 LIVE GATE CLOSED (2026-07-25, user mic run — "worked
  great!").** `subtraction_fact` / "subtraction within 5": **5/5 affirmed** +
  recap. One sitting closed three layers at once: the L0 judged loop end-to-end
  (no desync, stall, or phantom verdict), the reworked reward beat (pacing not
  flagged as dragging or clipping — the audio-edge design holds live), and the
  **first live run of the L2 catalog scaffold** — the tutor held the scripted
  lines across 5 items, so the 4 new `commonStruggles` did not loosen it into
  chattiness, which was the named risk of adding them. Also confirmed
  `subtraction_fact` cue wording + code-built `solvedDisplay` live (#49b).
  **The pack is now runtime-verified at L0+L1+L2.** HUMAN-CHECKS #48 struck.
  **Residual — third consecutive ALL-CORRECT sitting:** the correction branch,
  the homophone/over-affirmation stress, and the MATHEMATICS submit attribution
  all still need a deliberately WRONG answer → new HUMAN-CHECKS **#50**.
  Report: `qa/eval-reports/di-math-facts-live-2026-07-25.md`.
- **di-math-facts reward beat — one fact on screen at a time (2026-07-25, user
  browser check; CONFIRMED live same day).** The stage was showing the NEXT problem while the LAST
  answer's equation sat in a chip below it — two facts at once, overload at K.
  Fixed in two halves: (1) the completed equation now REPLACES the printed
  problem in the big slot instead of stacking under it; (2) `advance()` is
  deferred to a reward beat instead of firing at verdict time. The beat is
  **edge-driven, not timed** — the engine already sends the next `[DI_ITEM]` cue
  400ms after the tutor's audio falls (`VERIFY_BEAT_MS`), so the visual rides
  that same falling edge and the swap lands exactly when the tutor stops talking
  about this fact; a 900ms floor stops a clipped affirmation flashing past, a
  3s cap releases the stage if the edge never comes, and `attempt-open` /
  `resync` flush the beat so a resolved fact can never be up while the child
  answers the next one. `commitAdvance` bumps `idxRef` with the state (emissions
  fire inside the loop's dispatch, a render before React catches up). Applies to
  the capped-correction path too — `moveOnCue` CONTAINS the next fact's model
  line, so its swap belongs at the same edge. Verified: new jsdom suite
  `DiMathFacts.reward-beat.test.tsx` **6/6** (non-vacuity probed: reverting the
  deferred advance fails 2, reverting the in-place render fails a 3rd), full
  vitest **921/921**, tsc 0 Lumina errors. **The FEEL still needs the mic
  sitting — HUMAN-CHECKS #48 updated** (its old text described the removed
  behavior).
- **di-math-facts L2 tutoring scaffold (2026-07-25, birth-cert follow-up #2
  struck).** `DI_MATH_FACTS_TUTORING` moved from `diMathFactsScript.ts` into
  `catalog/di.ts` `tutoring:` — both connect paths now resolve it from the
  catalog (the shared family lesson-mode wiring from di-letter-sounds' L2 was
  already in place, so this pack needed no transport work). Cue lines and
  `judgingContract` untouched: the bench-proven wording is byte-identical.
  Added at this layer: `contextKeys` (challengeType/display/problem/facts —
  **stimulus side only**, the answer reaches the tutor inside the `[DI_ITEM]`
  contract, never RUNTIME STATE), 4 `commonStruggles`, and one NUMBER WORDS
  clause for the #48 homophone stress (a word that SOUNDS like the target
  number IS it — "won"/one, "too"/two, "for"/four, "ate"/eight; widened for
  homophones of the TARGET only). Component drops the local `tutoring:` arg and
  gains an `updateContext` effect (silent channel — never perturbs the judged
  loop); generator attaches the flat `facts` summary so RUNTIME STATE is
  populated from the first auth-time prompt. Verified: tsc 0 Lumina errors;
  `/tutor-test` **0 HIGH** (2 WARNs = the DI family's shape — `useLuminaAI`-bag
  parsing and `sendText` moments don't apply to a judged-loop cue path; same
  two as di-letter-sounds); Tier-2 probe on TWO modes shows all 4 keys
  populated with real values, no `(not set)`, no answer in RUNTIME STATE.
  Report: `qa/tutor-reports/di-math-facts-2026-07-25.md`. **Tier-3 rides
  HUMAN-CHECKS #48/#49** — the new struggle/homophone copy is exercised by the
  same sitting that drives the correction branch. Ladder next = `/add-support-tiers` (L3).
- **di-math-facts L1 eval-modes (2026-07-24, birth-cert follow-up #1 struck).**
  User chose the FULL birth-cert ladder — 4 identities: `counting_next` (β1.5),
  `answer_fact` (β2.0, L0 unchanged), `fact_review` (β2.5), `subtraction_fact`
  (β3.0). Standing gate 1 satisfied WITHOUT a new bench sitting: every mode
  answers with a spoken NUMBER WORD, the class benched in #46. The bench-proven
  L0 cue wording is byte-for-byte intact — the L0 lines were already phrased
  around `it.problem`, so all four skills read through the same proven sentences
  ("three minus one is two", "the number after five is six"); the only
  type-aware line is the counting DIRECTION in the judging contract (subtraction
  counts back, not up). Fork A held: code owns pools/answers/aliases and stamps
  `challengeType`. New code-built `solvedDisplay` field so the post-affirmation
  reward is correct per skill ("5 → 6", not "5 → ? = 6"). Verified: real-Gemini
  eval-test **PASS ×8** (4 pinned single-type + mixed = all-four interleave
  (SP-21) + curated blend), **40/40 challenges recomputed correct**, and
  `/topic-trace` on a real K subtraction topic routed manifest →
  **`subtraction_fact`** end-to-end (intent routing was newly live — with one
  mode it could never fire); typecheck:lumina 0; vitest 915/915. Caught + closed
  in the run: `fact_review` on a doubles objective drew ZERO doubles (anchors
  only applied to explicitly named facts) — now anchors ≤2 items from the
  focused pool for any scope. **The 3 new modes' cue wording is UNVERIFIED live
  → HUMAN-CHECKS #49** (fold into #48, one sitting). Report:
  `qa/eval-reports/di-math-facts-evalmodes-2026-07-24.md`. Deferred by design:
  G3 `multiplication_fact` (needs its own curriculum-fit probe + grade gate) and
  missing-addend (L4). Ladder next = `/add-tutoring-scaffold` (L2).
- **#3 di-math-facts — BORN L0 (2026-07-24).** Third DI pack, first MATH pack —
  separate content pack over the committed engine, sibling files untouched, NO
  hooks/ change. `DiMathFacts.tsx` + hand-authored `diMathFactsScript.ts`
  (BENCH-PROVEN cue wording from the #46 probe; permissive on th-fronting +
  counting-up, STRICT on a different number; sentinels = engine defaults,
  collision-checked) + `gemini-di-math-facts.ts` (Fork A: code-owned fact pool,
  scope code-enforced named→make-10→doubles→within-N→grade default K=5/G1=10;
  Gemini wrapper-only with digit/number-word leak-guard on title/description)

  retrieval matcher + mapping service + submission_service (both the
  use_retrieval gate AND resolve_by_retrieval — the second one mattered).
  Answer-leak rule: sum gated behind affirmation everywhere (stage equation
  reward, recap, generator title guard). Verified: typecheck:lumina 0; vitest
  915/915; backend pytest identical to HEAD baseline (10 pre-existing

  Birth cert + follow-up queue: `qa/eval-reports/di-math-facts-birth.md`.
  **Live loop NOT yet driven — HUMAN-CHECKS #48 is the real L0 gate**
  (correction branch never heard live + #46's homophone stress + MATHEMATICS
  attribution as the subject-override runtime check).
- **di-letter-sounds L2 tutoring scaffold + FAMILY lesson-mode wiring (2026-07-23,
  birth-cert follow-up #2 struck).** DI tutoring block moved from
  `diLetterSoundsScript.ts` into `catalog/di.ts` `tutoring:` (single source of
  truth; +contextKeys challengeType/letter/keyword/letters, +3 commonStruggles
  from birth QA; sentinel-collision re-checked on the new copy). The two carried
  L0 gaps CLOSED for the whole family: (a) **lesson-mode connect** — new
  `ComponentDefinition.audioInput` (types.ts); both DI packs declare
  `{ manual_activity: true }`; `connectLesson` scans the manifest and opens the
  shared Gemini session with it (audio config is connect-time-fixed);
  `switch_primitive` carries `tutoring` + `audio_input`; standalone `connect`
  falls back to the catalog for both — DiLetterSounds dropped its explicit
  passes. Subskill carry comes free in lesson mode (ManifestOrderRenderer
  injection → usePrimitiveEvaluation), ending the 07-21 Gemini re-map watch-item.
  (b) **`subject_for_domain('di') → LANGUAGE_ARTS`** in the retrieval matcher
  (REVISIT at di-math-facts birth — family will span subjects). Generator grew a
  flat `letters` summary field so the auth-time prompt resolves; component syncs
  per-item RUNTIME STATE via silent `updateContext`. Verified: typecheck:lumina 0;
  tutor-test Tier 1 PASS (0 HIGH; 2 WARNs structural to the engine pattern) +
  Tier 2 probe PASS (0 `(not set)`): `qa/tutor-reports/di-letter-sounds-2026-07-23.md`.
  **Live lesson-mode loop NOT driven → HUMAN-CHECKS #45** (incl. the named
  trade-off: a DI-bearing lesson runs manual VAD session-wide, so non-DI chat
  turns in a MIXED lesson won't open). di-word-reading's own catalog `tutoring:`
  move stays its L2 item; the shared wiring is already in place for it.
- **#2 di-word-reading — BORN L0 (2026-07-22).** Second DI pack over the
  committed engine — separate content pack, letter-sounds files untouched, NO
  hooks/ change. `DiWordReading.tsx` + hand-authored `diWordReadingScript.ts`
  (DISTAR two-branch cues: CVC sound-out "sss-aaa-mmm… sam" / sight whole-word;
  STRICT near-neighbour judging contract) + `gemini-di-word-reading.ts` (Fork A:
  30-CVC-by-vowel + 8-sight menu in code, Gemini enum-selects words,
  graphemes/emoji/aliases attached in code, vowel + sight scope CODE-enforced) +
  registrations (catalog/di.ts single `read_word` mode β2.5, diGenerators,
  metrics union, primitiveRegistry, ComponentId, backend problem_type_registry)
  + direct-instruction-tester grew a **Letter Sounds ⇄ Word Reading primitive
  picker** (no cloned tester). Answer-leak rule inverted vs letter-sounds
  honored: printed word ONLY before the read; emoji = post-affirmation reward.
  Sentinel note: handoff §4's classic "My turn." model opener re-worded to
  "I'll sound it out…" (collision with the correction sentinel). **Standing
  gate 1 (bench sitting #41) WAIVED by user ruling 2026-07-22** — near-neighbour
  stress folded into the live-loop check. typecheck:lumina 0; eval-test PASS ×4
  (named words honored / generic → CVC spread + 1 sight / sight-scoped → sight
  set only / "short a" → hard vowel scope). Curriculum-fit: **MATCH @ G1
  LA001-01** (0.800; LA001-07 Sight Words in top-5); K diffuse-abstain =
  vote-splitting across sibling CVC families (top-1 0.819 IS the right
  concept), not a gap. Birth cert + follow-up queue:

  lesson-mode connect + `subject_for_domain('di')` gaps carried to the family
  `/add-tutoring-scaffold` item, not re-solved.
- **#1 di-letter-sounds — BORN L0 (2026-07-20).** First DI primitive, first
  engine consumer. New family: `primitives/visual-primitives/direct-instruction/`
  (`DiLetterSounds.tsx` + hand-authored `diLetterSoundsScript.ts`), `catalog/di.ts`,
  `service/direct-instruction/gemini-di-letter-sounds.ts` (Fork A menu-scoped:
  curated continuant + short-vowel menu; Gemini picks target letters from the
  objective, code attaches spoken/keyword/emoji), `registry/generators/diGenerators.ts`.
  Standing gates met: sentinel-collision ✓ (engine defaults, no line opens with a
  sentinel), correction re-model/opener directive ✓ (in tutoring block + script).
  typecheck:lumina PASS; eval-test PASS ×3 (topic fidelity: named letters honored,
  generic → starter spread, vowels → keyword elicitation). Curriculum-fit: MATCH
  (K LANGUAGE_ARTS Letter-Sound Correspondence, top-1 0.788 — the starved GK band).
  Birth cert + follow-up queue: `qa/eval-reports/di-letter-sounds-birth.md`. **Live
  loop VERIFIED end-to-end 2026-07-21 (HUMAN-CHECKS #36 struck)** — user mic run PASS
  through the primitive; full data loop fired on submit (curriculum resolve → score
  9.2 → competency/calibration/mastery/+38 XP). **L0 fully runtime-verified; ladder
  UNBLOCKED (`/add-eval-modes` next).** Two known L0 gaps carried to
  `/add-tutoring-scaffold`: lesson-mode connect needs `manual_activity`+DI-tutoring
  through the shared session (the 07-21 run confirmed the standalone tester re-maps
  the subskill via Gemini — landed on CVC-decode LA001-01-a, not the letter-sound
  home; the lesson path must carry the objective's subskill instead); add
  `subject_for_domain('di')→LANGUAGE_ARTS` to the retrieval matcher.
- Engine stack steps 1–3 groundwork (bench POC → live-judged pivot → open-mic →
  extraction 1 `4af21b6` → engine `bc2d303`), runs 2026-07-19..21 all PASS.
