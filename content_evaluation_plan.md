# Content Quality and Evaluation System: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the development of a standalone content pipeline tool to automate the generation, evaluation, and optimization of educational content, based on the feedback from your machine learning engineer.

## System Architecture

The proposed system consists of a **Standalone Content Pipeline Tool** that interacts with your existing backend via its API. This architecture ensures that development on the pipeline can happen independently of your production application.

## Development Plan

The project is broken down into four distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Build the Evaluation Harness

**Goal:** Create the core components of our automated evaluation system.

*   **1.1: Define and Structure Quality Rubrics**
    *   Create a `rubrics.py` file to define Pydantic models for each quality dimension:
        *   `PedagogicalAlignment`
        *   `CognitiveLoad`
        *   `EngagementMetrics`
        *   `EfficacySignals`
        *   `Accessibility`
    *   Each model will contain fields for scores, justifications, and automated check results.

*   **1.2: Implement Tier 1 Structural Validation**
    *   Create a `structural_validator.py`.
    *   This validator will check for schema compliance, required field presence, and format consistency (e.g., image specs, text length).

*   **1.3: Implement Tier 2 Quality Heuristics**
    *   Create a `heuristics_validator.py`.
    *   Integrate libraries like `textstat` for readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid).
    *   Implement checks for visual quality (contrast ratios, resolution) and answer distribution analysis.

*   **1.4: Implement Tier 3 LLM-as-Judge**
    *   Create an `llm_judge.py` module.
    *   This module will use an LLM to evaluate content against the defined rubrics, checking for clarity, pedagogical soundness, and potential bias.
    *   It will generate scores, provide improvement suggestions, and flag content for human review.

*   **1.5: Create a Review Interface Schema**
    *   Define a JSON schema for the output of the evaluation pipeline. This schema will be used to generate reports and populate a review interface for items that need manual verification.

### Phase 2: Implement the Standalone Content Pipeline Tool

**Goal:** Create the command-line interface (CLI) that will orchestrate the content generation, evaluation, and management workflow.

*   **2.1: Set up the CLI Framework**
    *   Use a Python CLI library like `Typer` or `Click` to structure the tool.
    *   The main file will be `content_ops.py`.

*   **2.2: Implement API Client to Connect to Backend**
    *   Create an `api_client.py` module to handle all communications with your backend API. It will include functions to fetch curriculum data and push validated content.

*   **2.3: Implement 'generate' Command**
    *   The `generate` command will take arguments like `--subject`, `--skill`, and `--count`.
    *   It will use the `api_client` to fetch curriculum specs and then call your LLM to generate new problems.

*   **2.4: Implement 'evaluate' Command**
    *   The `evaluate` command will take a generated problem (or fetch an existing one) and run it through the full evaluation harness (Tiers 1-3).

*   **2.5: Implement Reporting and Logging**
    *   Integrate Python's `logging` module.
    *   The tool will output evaluation results as structured logs and generate reports in CSV or JSON format, summarizing the quality scores for each piece of content.

### Phase 3: Integrate Data Collection and Feedback Loops

**Goal:** Connect the evaluation system to real-world student performance data.

*   **3.1: Instrument the Application for Data Collection**
    *   This involves ensuring your frontend application and backend services are capturing the necessary engagement and performance data (e.g., completion rates, time spent, retry attempts). This step is primarily about verifying existing instrumentation.

*   **3.2: Create a Data Pipeline for Performance Metrics**
    *   Set up a data pipeline (e.g., using serverless functions or a scheduled job) to aggregate and process student performance data from your production database into an analytics database (like BigQuery).

*   **3.3: Build a Low-Performing Content Dashboard**
    *   Create a dashboard (e.g., using Google Data Studio, Looker, or a custom web interface) that connects to the analytics database to visualize content performance and automatically flag underperforming items.

*   **3.4: Link Performance Data to the Content Pipeline Tool**
    *   The `content_ops.py` tool will be updated with a command like `audit` that can query the analytics database to fetch performance data for existing content, allowing regeneration or review of low-performers.

### Phase 4: Develop Optimization and A/B Testing Capabilities

**Goal:** Transform the system into a learning loop that automatically analyzes performance and systematically improves content.

*   **4.1: Develop an Analysis Engine for Content Performance**
    *   Create a module (`performance_analyzer.py`) that analyzes the characteristics of high-performing vs. low-performing content to identify patterns.

*   **4.2: Implement Automated Content Regeneration**
    *   Add a feature to the `content_ops.py` tool (e.g., a `--regenerate-failures` flag) that automatically regenerates low-performing content with enhanced prompts based on insights from the.

*   **4.3: Build an A/B Testing Framework**
    *   Implement logic in the `content_ops.py` tool to generate variations of content for A/B testing.
    *   Your backend API will need a mechanism to serve different content versions to different user segments.

*   **4.4: Create a "Golden Dataset" Management System**
    *   Establish a process and storage mechanism (e.g., a dedicated folder with JSON files or a specific table in your database) for managing a "golden dataset" of exemplar problems. The `content_ops.py` tool will use this dataset for few-shot examples in prompts and as a benchmark for evaluation.
