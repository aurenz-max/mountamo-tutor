## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Technology Decisions
- **React Query**: Server state management with caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form state with validation
- **shadcn/ui + Radix**: Accessible, composable UI components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety

### Design Patterns
1. **Split Panel Layout**: Tree navigation + content tabs
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
3. **Draft Indicators**: Visual draft badges
4. **Role-Based Access**: Designer vs Admin permissions
5. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling

### Data Flow
```
Component → React Query Hook → API Client → Backend (port 8001)
                ↓
          Cache & Update UI
```
