Skill 1 focuses on developing an understanding of the number system and the ability to count and recognize numbers, which is essential for being able to accurately count objects. The two skills share core concepts related to counting, number recognition, and understanding the number system. Practicing Skill 1 can significantly reinforce and support the development of Skill 2, as the ability to count objects effectively relies on a strong grasp of the underlying number concepts."

Skill 1 provides the necessary understanding of numbers and their relationships, which is essential for effectively comparing and ordering numbers in Skill 2. The two skills share core concepts related to number sense and understanding, and practicing one can help reinforce the other. However, Skill 2 requires a deeper level of understanding and application, so it is not entirely dependent on Skill 1."

Knowing the basic counting sequence and number recognition is necessary for understanding ordinal numbers. The two skills share core concepts related to number sense and order, and practicing one can help reinforce the other. For example, understanding the count sequence can aid in recognizing ordinal positions. Overall, there is a strong dependency between the two skills, with a moderate level of similarity and reinforcement."

Skill 1 focuses on building a strong understanding of number names, the count sequence, and basic counting skills, which are essential for Skill 2. Skill 2 builds upon this foundation by requiring students to identify and represent the structure of numbers 11-19 as ten ones plus additional ones. The two skills share core concepts related to number sense and representation, and practicing one skill can reinforce the other, as a strong understanding of counting and cardinality is necessary for composing and decomposing numbers."

However, the two skills are not entirely dependent on each other, as some aspects of Skill 2 can be learned concurrently. The skills share some core concepts, such as recognition and understanding of basic shapes, but they focus on different mathematical domains. Practicing one skill may reinforce certain aspects of the other, such as using counting to compare shape properties, but the direct reinforcement is moderate."

The skills share some core concepts, such as recognizing and manipulating shapes, but they focus on different aspects of mathematics. However, practicing one skill can reinforce the other, as counting and shape recognition are interconnected. For example, counting the sides of shapes can help develop number sense, while recognizing shapes can aid in counting and understanding numerical patterns."
