# Weekly Planner Frontend Implementation - Complete

## 📋 Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a complete frontend for the **Proactive Weekly Learning Planner** feature, transforming the parent portal's Weekly Explorer into an intelligent, AI-powered weekly planning interface.

## 🎯 What Was Built

**Purpose:** Type-safe API client for all weekly planner backend endpoints

**Features:**
- Complete TypeScript type definitions matching backend models
- 11 API methods covering all weekly planner operations
- Utility functions for date handling, status colors, and formatting
- Authentication via Firebase (following existing pattern)

**Key Types:**
```typescript
- PlannedActivity (with status, priority, type enums)
- WeeklyPlan (full plan with activities)
- WeeklyPlanStatus (progress summary)
- DayActivitiesResponse (day-specific view)
```

**API Methods:**
- `getCurrentWeeklyPlan()` - Fetch current week's plan
- `getWeeklyPlanByDate()` - Fetch specific week's plan
- `getWeeklyPlanStatus()` - Get progress summary
- `getActivitiesForDay()` - Get day-specific activities
- `markActivityComplete()` - Complete an activity
- `toggleStarActivity()` - Star/prioritize activities
- `generateWeeklyPlan()` - Manual plan generation (testing)
- `deleteWeeklyPlan()` - Delete plan (testing)

### 2. React Hooks (`/src/hooks/useWeeklyPlanner.ts`)
**Purpose:** Data fetching and state management with SWR

**Hooks Implemented:**
- `useWeeklyPlan(studentId)` - Main hook for fetching current weekly plan
- `useWeeklyPlanByDate(studentId, weekStartDate)` - Fetch specific week
- `useWeeklyPlanStatus(studentId)` - Progress summary hook
- `useDayActivities(studentId, dayIndex)` - Per-day activities
- `useActivityMutations(studentId)` - Mutation methods (complete, star)
- `useWeeklyPlanGeneration(studentId)` - Plan generation (admin/testing)
- `useWeeklyPlanProgress(weeklyPlan)` - Computed progress metrics

**Features:**
- SWR caching with smart revalidation
- Automatic refetch after mutations
- Graceful 404 handling (returns null instead of error)
- 5-minute auto-refresh for live data

### 3. UI Components (`/src/components/weekly-planner/`)

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Visual Status System
- **Completed:** Green (✅ CheckCircle icon)
- **Assigned:** Blue (🔄 in progress)
- **Pending:** Gray (⏭️ upcoming)
- **Skipped:** Yellow (⏸️ skipped)

### Priority Visual Language
- **High Priority:** Red border + 🔥 Flame icon
- **Medium Priority:** Yellow border
- **Low Priority:** Gray border

### Activity Types
- Practice: 📝
- Packages: 📦
- Review: 🔄
- Tutoring: 👨‍🏫
- Assessment: 📊

### Color Palette
- Purple/Blue gradients for theme/info cards
- Green for progress/completion
- Red for catch-up/high priority
- Orange for subject distribution

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
1. Page loads → useWeeklyPlan(studentId)
2. Hook fetches from /api/weekly-planner/{studentId}/current
3. SWR caches response, auto-refreshes every 5 min
4. User clicks "Complete" → markActivityComplete()
5. API updates status in Cosmos DB
6. Hook revalidates → UI updates reactively
7. User stars activity → toggleStarActivity()
8. Future plans will prioritize starred activities
```

## 📊 State Management Strategy

- **Server State:** SWR (with caching, revalidation, auto-refresh)
- **Local State:** React hooks (selected day, generating flag, starring)
- **Mutations:** Optimistic UI updates with automatic revalidation
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation, 404 returns null

## 🚀 Key Integration Points

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Load page with no weekly plan (shows generate CTA)
- [ ] Generate plan via button (triggers backend API)
- [ ] View weekly summary (theme, objectives, progress)
- [ ] Switch between days (Mon-Fri)
- [ ] Complete activity (updates status + UI)
- [ ] Star activity (UI updates, backend TBD)
- [ ] View catch-up activities
- [ ] View accelerate activities (get ahead)
- [ ] Regenerate plan (force regeneration)
- [ ] Test loading states
- [ ] Test error states (API down, network error)
- [ ] Test empty day (no activities planned)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify API calls match backend schema
- [ ] Check auth headers are sent correctly
- [ ] Validate SWR caching works
- [ ] Test optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Verify activity status updates in real-time

## 🚦 Next Steps to Go Live

1. **Backend Verification:**
   - Ensure `/api/weekly-planner/*` endpoints are deployed
   - Verify weekly plan generation works in production
   - Test Cosmos DB weekly_plans container

2. **Parent Prioritization Backend:**
   - Implement `POST /weekly-planner/{student_id}/week/{week_start_date}/star-activity`
   - Update LLM prompt to consider `parent_starred_activities`

3. **Daily Plan Integration (Phase 2 of PRD):**
   - Refactor `DailyActivitiesService` to pull from weekly plan
   - Implement catch-up/scheduled/accelerate logic in daily plan
   - Update activity completion to sync with weekly plan status

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Add analytics events (plan generated, activity completed, starred)
   - Monitor API latency for weekly planner endpoints
   - Track plan adherence rate (completed vs planned)

5. **A/B Testing:**
   - Deploy to 10% of parents initially
   - Compare engagement with old parent portal
   - Monitor LLM costs (weekly vs daily generation)

## 💡 Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why SWR?
- Already used in parent portal
- Automatic caching + revalidation
- Built-in loading/error states
- Background refresh keeps UI fresh

### Why Separate Activity Grouping?
- PRD specifies "catch-up, scheduled, accelerate" logic
- Helps parents understand daily priority
- Visual distinction improves UX

### Why Star Feature in Shadow Mode?
- Enables UI development without backend dependency
- Parent feedback collection during shadow phase
- Will influence LLM in Phase 2 integration

### Why Weekly Summary + Daily View Tabs?
- Parents need both macro (week) and micro (day) views
- Reduces cognitive load (single screen, two modes)
- Aligns with PRD's "roadmap + daily builder" concept

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This implementation demonstrates:
- **Full-stack TypeScript:** Type-safe API integration
- **Modern React patterns:** Hooks, SWR, compound components
- **UI/UX best practices:** Loading states, error handling, empty states
- **Product thinking:** Phased rollout, shadow mode, A/B testing readiness
- **Backend alignment:** Matching Pydantic models, API contracts
