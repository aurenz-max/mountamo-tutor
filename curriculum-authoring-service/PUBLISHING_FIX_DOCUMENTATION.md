# Publishing API Fix - subject_id Column Addition

## Problem Summary

The publishing API was failing with error:
```
Name subject_id not found inside p at [6:29]
```

**Root Cause:** The `curriculum_prerequisites` table did not have a `subject_id` column, but the publishing code in [`version_control.py`](app/services/version_control.py) assumed it existed when filtering prerequisites.

---

## Solution Implemented

Added `subject_id` column to the `curriculum_prerequisites` table to enable efficient querying and proper version control during publishing.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File:** [`app/core/database.py`](app/core/database.py)
- **Line 95:** Added `subject_id` field to prerequisites schema
- Schema now includes: `prerequisite_id`, `subject_id`, `prerequisite_entity_id`, `prerequisite_entity_type`, `unlocks_entity_id`, `unlocks_entity_type`, `min_proficiency_threshold`, `version_id`, `is_draft`, `created_at`

```python
def get_prerequisites_schema(self) -> List[bigquery.SchemaField]:
    """Schema for curriculum_prerequisites table (polymorphic relationships)"""
    return [
        bigquery.SchemaField("prerequisite_id", "STRING", mode="REQUIRED"),
        bigquery.SchemaField("subject_id", "STRING", mode="REQUIRED"),  # âœ… ADDED
        # ... rest of fields
    ]
```

### 2. Pydantic Model Updates
**File:** [`app/models/prerequisites.py`](app/models/prerequisites.py)

**PrerequisiteBase Model (Line 15):** Added `subject_id` field
```python
class PrerequisiteBase(BaseModel):
    """Base model for Prerequisite"""
    subject_id: str  # âœ… ADDED
    prerequisite_entity_id: str
    prerequisite_entity_type: EntityType
    # ... rest of fields
```

**PrerequisiteCreate Model (Line 22):** Modified to NOT inherit `subject_id` from base
- The API resolves `subject_id` from the entity relationships (lines 94-116 in `prerequisites.py`)
- This keeps the API interface clean while ensuring data integrity

```python
class PrerequisiteCreate(BaseModel):
    """Model for creating a new prerequisite relationship (subject_id resolved by API)"""
    # Does NOT include subject_id - resolved by API
    prerequisite_entity_id: str
    prerequisite_entity_type: EntityType
    unlocks_entity_id: str
    unlocks_entity_type: EntityType
    min_proficiency_threshold: Optional[float] = Field(default=0.8, ge=0.0, le=1.0)
```

### 3. Service Layer Update
**File:** [`app/services/prerequisite_manager.py`](app/services/prerequisite_manager.py)
- **Line 28:** Added `subject_id` parameter to `create_prerequisite()` method
- **Line 37:** Include `subject_id` in prerequisite data

```python
async def create_prerequisite(
    self,
    prerequisite: PrerequisiteCreate,
    version_id: str,
    subject_id: str  # âœ… ADDED
) -> Prerequisite:
    prerequisite_data = {
        "prerequisite_id": prerequisite_id,
        "subject_id": subject_id,  # âœ… ADDED
        **prerequisite.dict(),
        "version_id": version_id,
        "is_draft": True,
        "created_at": now.isoformat()
    }
```

### 4. API Endpoint Update
**File:** [`app/api/prerequisites.py`](app/api/prerequisites.py)
- **Line 124-127:** Pass `subject_id` to prerequisite manager
- The API already had logic to resolve `subject_id` (lines 94-116), so we just needed to pass it

```python
result = await prerequisite_manager.create_prerequisite(
    prerequisite,
    version_id,
    subject_id  # âœ… ADDED
)
```

### 5. Database Migration
**File:** [`scripts/add_subject_id_to_prerequisites.sql`](scripts/add_subject_id_to_prerequisites.sql)

Successfully executed migration queries:

```sql
-- 1. Add column
ALTER TABLE `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites`
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subject_id STRING;

-- 2a. Backfill for skill prerequisites
MERGE `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites` AS p
USING (
    SELECT prereq.prerequisite_id, u.subject_id
    FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites` prereq
    JOIN `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_skills` s 
        ON prereq.unlocks_entity_id = s.skill_id
    JOIN `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_units` u 
        ON s.unit_id = u.unit_id
    WHERE prereq.unlocks_entity_type = 'skill' 
        AND prereq.subject_id IS NULL
) AS source
ON p.prerequisite_id = source.prerequisite_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET p.subject_id = source.subject_id;

-- 2b. Backfill for subskill prerequisites
MERGE `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites` AS p
USING (
    SELECT prereq.prerequisite_id, u.subject_id
    FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites` prereq
    JOIN `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_subskills` ss 
        ON prereq.unlocks_entity_id = ss.subskill_id
    JOIN `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_skills` s 
        ON ss.skill_id = s.skill_id
    JOIN `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_units` u 
        ON s.unit_id = u.unit_id
    WHERE prereq.unlocks_entity_type = 'subskill' 
        AND prereq.subject_id IS NULL
) AS source
ON p.prerequisite_id = source.prerequisite_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET p.subject_id = source.subject_id;
```

---

## Publishing Code Already Fixed

The publishing code in [`version_control.py`](app/services/version_control.py) already had the correct queries using `subject_id`:

- **Line 235-242:** `get_draft_changes()` filters prerequisites by `subject_id`
- **Line 464-480:** `publish()` MERGE query uses `subject_id` for prerequisites

These queries now work correctly with the new schema.

---

## Benefits

âœ… **Direct subject_id access** - No need for complex JOINs  
âœ… **Efficient queries** - Prerequisites can be filtered by subject directly  
âœ… **Proper version control** - Publishing workflow now works correctly  
âœ… **Data integrity** - All existing prerequisites backfilled successfully  
âœ… **Minimal code changes** - Leveraged existing API logic  

---

## How to Test

### 1. Test Prerequisite Creation
```bash
# Create a new prerequisite
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/prerequisites \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prerequisite_entity_id": "skill_123",
    "prerequisite_entity_type": "skill",
    "unlocks_entity_id": "skill_456",
    "unlocks_entity_type": "skill",
    "min_proficiency_threshold": 0.8
  }'
```

### 2. Test Draft Changes
```bash
# Get draft changes for a subject
curl http://localhost:8000/api/publishing/subjects/math/draft-changes
```

### 3. Test Publishing
```bash
# Publish draft changes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/publishing/subjects/math/publish \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "subject_id": "math",
    "version_description": "Test publish with new schema",
    "change_summary": "Testing subject_id in prerequisites"
  }'
```

## Validation Queries

Run these in BigQuery to validate the fix:

```sql
-- Check all prerequisites have subject_id
SELECT COUNT(*) as missing_count
FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites`
WHERE subject_id IS NULL;

-- Should return 0

-- View subject distribution
SELECT 
    subject_id,
    COUNT(*) as prerequisite_count
FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites`
GROUP BY subject_id
ORDER BY prerequisite_count DESC;
```

## Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| [`app/core/database.py`](app/core/database.py) | 95 | Added subject_id to prerequisites schema |
| [`app/models/prerequisites.py`](app/models/prerequisites.py) | 15, 22-28 | Updated PrerequisiteBase and PrerequisiteCreate models |
| [`app/services/prerequisite_manager.py`](app/services/prerequisite_manager.py) | 28, 37 | Added subject_id parameter and usage |
| [`app/api/prerequisites.py`](app/api/prerequisites.py) | 127 | Pass subject_id to manager |
| [`scripts/add_subject_id_to_prerequisites.sql`](scripts/add_subject_id_to_prerequisites.sql) | New file | Migration queries |

---

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. Revert code changes (git revert)
2. Remove subject_id column (NOT recommended if data is already using it):
```sql
ALTER TABLE `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum_prerequisites`
DROP COLUMN subject_id;
```

However, keeping the column is recommended as it improves query performance.

---

## Conclusion

The publishing API error has been resolved by adding `subject_id` to the prerequisites table. This change:
- Fixes the immediate error
- Improves query performance
- Maintains data integrity
- Requires minimal code changes

The migration was successful, and all existing prerequisites now have proper `subject_id` values.
