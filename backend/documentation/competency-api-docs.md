## Models and Data Structures

### CompetencyUpdate Model
```python
class CompetencyUpdate(BaseModel):
    student_id: int
    subject: str
    skill: str
    subskill: str
    session_evaluation: Dict[str, Any]
```

### CompetencyQuery Model
```python
class CompetencyQuery(BaseModel):
    student_id: int
    subject: str
    skill: str
    subskill: str
```

### Competency Calculation
Competency scores are calculated using a blended approach:
- Actual average score from attempts
- Credibility factor based on number of attempts
- Default score weighting for new or low-credibility skills

Formula: `blended_score = (average_score * credibility) + (default_score * (1 - credibility))`

Credibility thresholds:
- Subskill: 15 attempts for full credibility
- Subject: 150 attempts for full credibility

## Error Handling

All endpoints are wrapped with try-except blocks to provide appropriate error responses:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message describing the issue"
}
```

Possible HTTP status codes:
- 200: Successful operation
- 404: Resource not found (subject, skill, etc.)
- 500: Internal server error (with error details)

## Implementation Notes

- The API uses dependency injection for services like `CompetencyService` and `ProblemRecommender`
- Syllabus data is loaded from CSV files with a specific structure
- The system supports structured feedback with components for observation, analysis, evaluation, and feedback
