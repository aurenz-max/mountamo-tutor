You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a curriculum syllabus provided in CSV format and generating an inferred learning path dependency graph.

**Input:**
The input is a CSV file containing syllabus information. Key columns include:
*   `Subject`
*   `Grade`
*   `UnitID`
*   `UnitTitle`
*   `SkillID`
*   `SkillDescription`
*   (Optionally other columns like `SubskillID`, `DifficultyStart`, etc., which can provide context)

**Task:**
Create a dependency graph representing the logical sequence of skills a student should learn. This graph should be structured as a JSON object.

**Level of Detail:**
Generate the dependency graph at the **[Specify Level, e.g., SkillID]** level.

**Inference Logic:**
The CSV file does **not** explicitly state prerequisites between skills. You must **infer** these dependencies based on:
1.  **Conceptual Flow:** Identify foundational skills that introduce basic concepts needed for more complex skills later on.
2.  **Topic Progression:** Assume skills within a unit or related units might build upon each other sequentially (e.g., identifying parts before analyzing systems, defining terms before applying them).
3.  **Implicit Dependencies:** Recognize when the description of one skill implies knowledge or ability from another (e.g., 'comparing' requires having identified items first; 'analyzing historical events' requires understanding timelines).
4.  **General Curriculum Structure:** Consider the typical pedagogical order of topics for the specified `Subject` and `Grade`.
5.  **(Optional) Difficulty:** You can use difficulty ratings, if provided, as a secondary clue, but prioritize conceptual logic.

**Output Format:**
Produce a JSON object where:
*   Each key is a **[Specify Level ID, e.g., SkillID]** from the syllabus.
*   The value associated with each key is a list of **[Specify Level ID, e.g., SkillID]**s that a student could logically progress to *after* mastering the key skill.
*   If a skill is inferred to be a likely endpoint for this grade level or doesn't directly unlock other specific skills *within this syllabus*, the associated list should be empty (`[]`).

**Example JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "SUBJECT_skill_paths": {
    "SKILL_ID_A": ["SKILL_ID_B", "SKILL_ID_C"],
    "SKILL_ID_B": ["SKILL_ID_D"],
    "SKILL_ID_C": [],
    "SKILL_ID_D": []
  }
}
```

**Action:**
Analyze the syllabus data provided below and generate the inferred **[Specify Level, e.g., SkillID]**-level dependency graph in the specified JSON format.

--- START OF FILE [Your_Filename.csv] ---
[Paste the entire content of your CSV file here]
--- END OF FILE [Your_Filename.csv] ---
```

**How to Use:**

1.  Replace `[Specify Level, e.g., SkillID]` with the actual column name you want to use for the nodes in your graph (likely `SkillID`).
2.  Replace `[Your_Filename.csv]` with the actual name of your file (optional, just for clarity).
3.  Replace `[Paste the entire content of your CSV file here]` with the actual text content of your CSV data.
4.  Adjust the `SUBJECT_skill_paths` key name in the example structure if desired.
5.  Run the prompt.
