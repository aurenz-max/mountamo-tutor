# Curriculum Integration Testing Checklist

## Status: Ready for Testing ‚úÖ

All backend code is complete. Follow this checklist to validate the integration works end-to-end.

---

## Phase 1: Database Setup & Validation (5 minutes)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Run SQL Script
**What:** Create compatibility views in BigQuery

**How:**
1. Open [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. Select project: `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta`
3. Open query editor
4. Copy entire contents of `backend/scripts/create_curriculum_views.sql`
5. Click "Run"

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Table dropped: analytics.curriculum
‚úÖ View created: analytics.curriculum
‚úÖ Table created: analytics.learning_paths
‚úÖ View created: analytics.v_subskill_prerequisites
```

**Verification Queries:** (Run these in BigQuery)
```sql
-- 1. Check curriculum view has data
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_subskills, COUNT(DISTINCT subject) as subjects
FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum`;
-- Expected: Should show count of subskills and subjects (e.g., 100+ subskills, 4 subjects)

-- 2. Check learning paths has data
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_relationships
FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.learning_paths`;
-- Expected: Should show count of skill relationships (e.g., 20+ relationships)

-- 3. Verify curriculum view structure
SELECT * FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum` LIMIT 5;
-- Expected: Should show subject, grade, unit_id, skill_id, subskill_id, descriptions, difficulties
```

**Status:** [ ] Complete

‚úÖ Learning paths table refreshed from analytics.curriculum_prerequisites
‚úÖ Curriculum view validated: XXX subskills, XXX skills, X subjects
...
üéâ Full data load completed successfully!
```

**Look for these specific messages:**
