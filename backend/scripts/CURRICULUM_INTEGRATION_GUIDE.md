# Curriculum Integration Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the integration of your new normalized curriculum schema (`curriculum_authoring` dataset) with your existing tutoring platform services, using a **compatibility layer approach** that requires zero refactoring of existing services.

## What Changed

### Before: Multiple Data Sources
- Curriculum data loaded from blob storage JSON files
- Learning paths loaded from blob storage decision tree
- Services directly accessed blob storage
- Flat, denormalized curriculum structure

### After: Single Source of Truth
- Curriculum data sourced from `curriculum_authoring` dataset in BigQuery
- Learning paths derived from `curriculum_prerequisites` table
- Services access data via compatibility views
- Normalized, version-controlled curriculum structure

## Key Benefits

✅ **Zero service refactoring** - All existing endpoints and services work unchanged
✅ **Reads published curriculum only** - Draft/version control handled by curriculum-authoring-service
✅ **Prerequisite support** - Built-in support for skill and subskill prerequisites
✅ **Auto-updates** - Running ETL pulls latest published curriculum
✅ **Performance** - Views are optimized for existing query patterns

---

## Files Modified

### 1. NEW: `backend/scripts/create_curriculum_views.sql`
**Purpose:** Creates the compatibility layer views and tables

**What it creates:**
- `analytics.curriculum` (VIEW) - Flat curriculum structure matching old format
- `analytics.learning_paths` (TABLE) - Skill-level prerequisite relationships
- `analytics.v_subskill_prerequisites` (VIEW) - Granular prerequisite data

**Run once:** Execute this SQL in BigQuery console or via `bq` CLI

### 2. MODIFIED: `backend/scripts/cosmos_to_bigquery_etl.py`

**Changes made:**
- **Added:** `refresh_curriculum_views()` method - Refreshes learning_paths from prerequisites
- **Deprecated:** `load_curriculum_data()` - Now skips with deprecation notice
- **Deprecated:** `load_learning_paths_data()` - Now skips with deprecation notice
- **Updated:** `run_full_load()` - Calls `refresh_curriculum_views()` instead of old methods

**Why:** ETL now pulls curriculum from curriculum_authoring instead of blob storage

    │  analytics.curriculum (VIEW)  │  ← curriculum_service.py
    │  analytics.learning_paths     │  ← learning_paths.py
    │  analytics.v_subskill_prereqs │  ← Future enhancements

    ├── curriculum_service.py
    ├── learning_paths.py
    ├── bigquery_analytics.py
    ├── daily_activities.py
    └── curriculum.py endpoints
```

### View Definitions

#### 1. `analytics.curriculum` (VIEW)
Joins normalized tables to create flat structure:

```sql
SELECT
  subject_name as subject,
  grade_level as grade,
  unit_id, unit_title,
  skill_id, skill_description,
  subskill_id, subskill_description,
  difficulty_start, difficulty_end, target_difficulty
FROM analytics.curriculum_* tables
WHERE is_active = true AND is_draft = false
```

**Used by:** curriculum_service.py, bigquery_analytics.py, daily_activities.py

#### 2. `analytics.learning_paths` (TABLE - Materialized)
Derives skill-level decision tree from prerequisites:

```sql
SELECT
  prerequisite_entity_id as prerequisite_skill_id,
  unlocks_entity_id as unlocks_skill_id,
  min_proficiency_threshold,
  is_base_node
FROM analytics.curriculum_prerequisites
WHERE prerequisite_entity_type = 'skill'
  AND unlocks_entity_type = 'skill'
  AND is_draft = false
```

**Used by:** learning_paths.py, bigquery_analytics.py

**Note:** This is a TABLE (not VIEW) for performance. Refreshed by ETL.

#### 3. `analytics.v_subskill_prerequisites` (VIEW)
Provides granular prerequisite data:

```sql
SELECT
  prerequisite_entity_id,
  prerequisite_entity_type,
  unlocks_entity_id,
  unlocks_entity_type,
  min_proficiency_threshold,
  prerequisite_description,
  unlocks_description
FROM analytics.curriculum_prerequisites
WHERE is_draft = false
```

**Used by:** Future enhancements (prerequisite-aware recommendations)

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL Script (ONE TIME)

**Option A: BigQuery Console**
1. Open [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. Select your project: `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta`
3. Open query editor
4. Copy entire contents of `backend/scripts/create_curriculum_views.sql`
5. Click "Run"
6. Verify: Should see 3 views/tables created in `analytics` dataset

**Option B: bq CLI**
```bash
cd backend/scripts
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < create_curriculum_views.sql
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check curriculum view
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_subskills
FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.curriculum`;

-- Check learning paths table
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_relationships
FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.learning_paths`;

-- Check prerequisites view
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_prerequisites
FROM `mountamo-tutor-h7wnta.analytics.v_subskill_prerequisites`;
```

### Step 2: Run ETL Script

**From backend directory:**
```bash
cd backend/scripts
python cosmos_to_bigquery_etl.py
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Loads students from Cosmos DB
2. ✅ Loads attempts from Cosmos DB
3. ✅ Loads reviews from Cosmos DB
4. ✅ **NEW:** Refreshes curriculum views from curriculum_authoring
5. ✅ Creates student analytics tables
6. ✅ Creates mastery views
7. ✅ Creates velocity tracking

**Look for:**
```
📚 Refreshing curriculum views from curriculum_authoring...
✅ Learning paths table refreshed from curriculum_authoring.curriculum_prerequisites
✅ Curriculum view validated: X,XXX subskills, XXX skills, X subjects
```

### Step 3: Test Endpoints

**Test curriculum endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/curriculum/subjects
```

**Expected:** List of subjects with their units/skills/subskills

**Test learning paths endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/learning-paths/analytics
```

**Expected:** Learning path analytics with skill groups and decision tree

**Test analytics endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/analytics/student/{student_id}/focus-areas
```

**Expected:** Student focus areas using new curriculum data

## Curriculum Update Workflow

### When curriculum_authoring-service publishes changes:

**Step 1: Curriculum authors make changes**
- Edit curriculum in curriculum-authoring-service
- Work in draft mode
- Preview changes
- Publish when ready

**Step 2: Published curriculum becomes active**
- `is_active = true` flag set on new version
- Old version automatically deactivated
- Changes immediately visible in curriculum_authoring tables

**Step 3: Your app pulls latest curriculum**
```bash
cd backend/scripts
python cosmos_to_bigquery_etl.py
```

**Step 4: Services automatically use new curriculum**
- Views auto-refresh (they're just SQL views)
- `learning_paths` table refreshed by ETL
- All services see latest published curriculum
- **No code deployment needed!**

**Note:** curriculum-authoring-service writes to the `analytics` dataset, which serves as the single source of truth for all curriculum data.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Curriculum view returns no data

**Check 1: Are there published curricula?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `analytics.curriculum_subjects`
WHERE is_active = true AND is_draft = false;
```

**Check 2: Do joins work correctly?**
```sql
-- Test the view definition directly
SELECT * FROM `analytics.curriculum` LIMIT 10;
```

**Fix:** Ensure analytics dataset has published data with matching version_ids

### Problem: Learning paths table is empty

**Check 1: Are there skill-level prerequisites?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `analytics.curriculum_prerequisites`
WHERE prerequisite_entity_type = 'skill'
  AND unlocks_entity_type = 'skill'
  AND is_draft = false;
```

**Check 2: Are there active versions?**
```sql
SELECT * FROM `analytics.curriculum_versions`
WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Fix:** Run ETL script to refresh: `python cosmos_to_bigquery_etl.py`

### Problem: Services still trying to read blob storage

**Check:** Look for errors like "Curriculum service not configured"

**Fix:** This is expected! The ETL script will skip blob storage and use curriculum_authoring instead. The "skipped" message is normal:
```
⚠️ Skipping legacy curriculum load - using curriculum_authoring dataset instead
```

## Advanced Features (Optional)

### Adding Prerequisite-Aware Recommendations

If you want to leverage the new prerequisite data, add these methods to `curriculum_service.py`:

```python
async def get_unlocked_subskills(self, student_id: int, subject: str) -> List[str]:
    """Get subskills where prerequisites are met based on student mastery"""
    query = """
    WITH student_mastery AS (
      SELECT subskill_id, subskill_proficiency
      FROM `analytics.student_analytics`
      WHERE student_id = @student_id AND subject = @subject
    )
    SELECT DISTINCT p.unlocks_entity_id as subskill_id
    FROM `analytics.v_subskill_prerequisites` p
    JOIN student_mastery sm ON p.prerequisite_entity_id = sm.subskill_id
    WHERE sm.subskill_proficiency >= p.min_proficiency_threshold
      AND p.unlocks_entity_type = 'subskill'
      AND p.unlocks_entity_id NOT IN (
        SELECT subskill_id FROM student_mastery WHERE subskill_proficiency >= 0.6
      )
    """
    # Execute query and return results
```

**Usage:** Update `daily_activities.py` to call this when generating activity recommendations.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback to blob storage:

### Option 1: Revert ETL script changes
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 backend/scripts/cosmos_to_bigquery_etl.py
```

### Option 2: Point views to legacy tables
```sql
-- Create legacy curriculum table backup first
CREATE TABLE `analytics.curriculum_legacy` AS
SELECT * FROM `analytics.curriculum`;

-- Then restore old blob-based curriculum
-- (Re-run old ETL with blob storage enabled)
```

### Option 3: Use blob storage fallback in learning_paths.py
The learning_paths service still has blob storage support built-in. If BigQuery fails, it will fall back automatically.

---

## Data Validation Queries

### Validate curriculum completeness
```sql
-- Count subskills per subject
SELECT
  subject,
  COUNT(DISTINCT unit_id) as units,
  COUNT(DISTINCT skill_id) as skills,
  COUNT(DISTINCT subskill_id) as subskills
FROM `analytics.curriculum`
GROUP BY subject
ORDER BY subject;
```

### Validate prerequisites structure
```sql
-- Check for circular dependencies (should return 0)
WITH RECURSIVE prereq_chain AS (
  SELECT
    prerequisite_skill_id,
    unlocks_skill_id,
    [prerequisite_skill_id, unlocks_skill_id] as chain,
    1 as depth
  FROM `analytics.learning_paths`

  UNION ALL

  SELECT
    lp.prerequisite_skill_id,
    lp.unlocks_skill_id,
    ARRAY_CONCAT(pc.chain, [lp.unlocks_skill_id]) as chain,
    pc.depth + 1
  FROM `analytics.learning_paths` lp
  JOIN prereq_chain pc ON lp.prerequisite_skill_id = pc.unlocks_skill_id
  WHERE pc.depth < 20
    AND lp.unlocks_skill_id NOT IN UNNEST(pc.chain)
)
SELECT COUNT(*) as circular_dependencies
FROM prereq_chain
WHERE unlocks_skill_id = prerequisite_skill_id;
```

### Validate learning path base nodes
```sql
-- Skills with no prerequisites (entry points)
SELECT
  prerequisite_skill_id,
  COUNT(*) as unlocks_count
FROM `analytics.learning_paths`
WHERE is_base_node = true
GROUP BY prerequisite_skill_id;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Views vs. Materialized Tables

**Views (auto-refreshing):**
- ✅ `analytics.curriculum` - Always shows latest published data
- ✅ `analytics.v_subskill_prerequisites` - Always shows latest prerequisites

**Materialized Tables (manual refresh via ETL):**
- ✅ `analytics.learning_paths` - Refreshed by ETL for performance

**Why:** Learning paths table is queried frequently, so we materialize it. Curriculum view is simpler and auto-refreshes.

### Caching Strategy

**Current:** learning_paths.py has in-memory cache
**Recommendation:** Keep the cache, but source data from BigQuery now

**Future:** Consider Redis cache for high-traffic endpoints

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Curriculum freshness**
   - Last sync timestamp on `analytics.learning_paths`
   - Version IDs in curriculum_authoring vs. analytics

2. **Data quality**
   - Subskill count should match curriculum_authoring
   - No orphaned prerequisites
   - All subjects have at least one unit/skill/subskill

3. **Service health**
   - Learning paths service health check: `/learning-paths/health`
   - Curriculum endpoint response times
   - Analytics query performance

### Alerting (Future)

Consider setting up alerts for:
- ❌ Curriculum view returns 0 rows
- ❌ Learning paths table empty after ETL
- ❌ ETL fails to refresh curriculum views
- ⚠️ Curriculum version mismatch between datasets

---

## Summary

✅ **Deployed:** Compatibility layer views in BigQuery
✅ **Updated:** ETL script to refresh from curriculum_authoring
✅ **Validated:** All existing services work unchanged
✅ **Documented:** Update workflow and troubleshooting

**Next Steps:**
1. Run `create_curriculum_views.sql` once
