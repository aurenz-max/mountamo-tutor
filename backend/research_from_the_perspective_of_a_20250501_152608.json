  "report": "### FINAL RESEARCH REPORT ###\n\n**1. Introduction**\nExcavators are really, really big machines! They look like giant toy trucks with a big arm. They are super cool because they help people build things like houses and roads by digging in the dirt and moving big piles of stuff. [Search 1, 4]\n\n**2. How It Works**\nImagine an excavator is a strong robot helper! A driver sits inside a little room called the cab and uses special handles, like joysticks in a video game, to tell the excavator what to do. [Search 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] The handles make the big arm move up, down, and side to side. At the end of the arm is a giant scoop, called a bucket. The driver makes the bucket dig into the dirt, scoop it up, lift it high, and then dump it somewhere else! [Search 1, 3, 5] The top part of the excavator can even spin all the way around so it can work in different spots without moving its feet! [Search 1, 4]\n\n**3. Key Parts**\nExcavators have important parts that help them do their job:\n*   **Cab:** This is the little house where the driver sits to control everything. [Search 2, 4, 5]\n*   **Arm:** This is the long part that reaches out. It's like the excavator's strong arm! It has two parts that bend, the boom and the stick. [Search 2, 5]\n*   **Bucket:** This is the big scoop at the end of the arm. It's like a super strong spoon that digs and picks up dirt, rocks, and sand. [Search 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n*   **Tracks:** These are like giant tank treads or big feet that help the excavator move around, even on bumpy ground or mud. [Search 2, 4, 5]\n*   **Engine:** This part makes the excavator go and gives it power, kind of like the engine in a car. [Search 2]\n*   **Hydraulics:** This is a special system that uses fluid to make the arm and bucket move with lots of strength! [Search 2, 3, 5]\n*   **Counterweight:** This is a heavy part at the back that helps the excavator stay balanced when it lifts heavy things so it doesn't tip over! [Search 2]\n\n**4. Real World Examples**\nExcavators are busy helpers in many places!\n*   They dig big holes when people are building new houses or swimming pools. [Search 1, 4, 5]\n*   They help build roads by moving lots of dirt and rocks. [Search 1, 4]\n*   They can move really big and heavy things that people can't lift. [Search 4, 5]\n\n**5. Fun Facts**\n*   Sometimes excavators are called diggers or backhoes! [Search 4]\n*   They can be really big, some as heavy as lots and lots of elephants! [Search 5]\n\n### END OF REPORT ###",
