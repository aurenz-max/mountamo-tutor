Exhibit 1: Length Comparison
Title: "Longer or Shorter?"
Layout: A large board divided into two sections, labeled "Longer" and "Shorter."
Content:
Visuals: Display pairs of common objects with clearly different lengths (e.g., a long pencil and a short pencil, a long crayon and a short crayon, a long toy car and a short toy car). Mount each pair on the board with a small space between them. Use bright, primary colors for the board and labels.
Interactive Element: Include detachable arrows (maybe with Velcro) that the children can place pointing to the "Longer" or "Shorter" object in each pair.
Labels: Clear, large-print labels for "Longer" and "Shorter." Also, simple labels under each object indicating what it is (e.g., "Pencil," "Crayon," "Car").
Instructional Text: (Small, simple): "Look at the two things. Which one is longer? Which one is shorter? Point to the longer one. Point to the shorter one."

Exhibit 2: Weight Comparison
Title: "Heavier or Lighter?"
Layout: A simple balance scale with two clear plastic buckets.
Content:
Visuals: Provide a selection of objects with noticeable weight differences but that are manageable for small children (e.g., a small rock, a plastic toy, a wooden block, a feather, a small book).
Interactive Element: Children can place objects in the buckets to see which is heavier and which is lighter.
Labels: Clear labels for "Heavier" (pointing down) and "Lighter" (pointing up) near the balance scale.
Instructional Text: "Put one thing in each bucket. Which side goes down? That one is heavier! Which side goes up? That one is lighter!"

Exhibit 3: Size Comparison
Title: "Bigger or Smaller?"
Layout: A table with differently sized nesting dolls or differently sized stacking cups.
Content:
Visuals: Use brightly colored nesting dolls or stacking cups.
Interactive Element: Children can manipulate the nesting dolls or stacking cups, comparing their sizes.
Labels: Create labels, "Biggest," "Bigger," "Small," "Smallest" that children can place next to the appropriate doll or cup.
Instructional Text: "Can you find the biggest one? Can you find the smallest one? Put them in order from biggest to smallest!"
