# AI Recommendations & Daily Activities Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration of AI-powered recommendations with the daily activities system, addressing hardcoded limitations and improving velocity metrics utilization. The current system effectively uses velocity metrics but has rigid allocation rules that limit adaptability to individual student needs.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Strengths
- **Velocity Metrics Integration**: Well-implemented BigQuery integration with `student_velocity_metrics` table
- **Pedagogical Structure**: Sound 4-part learning approach (warm-up, core challenges, practice, cool-down)
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust degradation from AI → BigQuery → static activities
- **Curriculum Metadata**: Rich activity enrichment with subject, skill, and subskill data

### ❌ Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Hardcoded Activity Allocation Rules
**Location**: `backend/app/services/ai_recommendations.py:176-181`
```python
# Current hardcoded allocation
if velocity_pct < 70: allocation = 3
elif velocity_pct < 85: allocation = 2
else: allocation = 1
```

**Impact**: No adaptability to student preferences, time constraints, or learning goals

#### 2. Fixed Pedagogical Structure
**Location**: `backend/app/services/ai_recommendations.py:206-213`
```python
# Fixed 4-part structure
pedagogical_flow = [
    {"activity_type": "warm_up", "purpose": "confidence_builder", "count": 1},
    {"activity_type": "core_challenge", "purpose": "new_learning", "count": 2},
    {"activity_type": "practice_reinforcement", "purpose": "skill_building", "count": 2},
    {"activity_type": "cool_down", "purpose": "engaging_review", "count": 1}
]
```

**Impact**: Cannot adjust for different session lengths or learning objectives

#### 3. Hardcoded Activity Count
**Location**: Multiple locations defaulting to `target_activities: int = 6`
**Impact**: No flexibility for shorter/longer learning sessions

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Dynamic Activity Allocation System

#### Configuration-Driven Allocation Rules
```python
class ActivityAllocationConfig(BaseModel):
    velocity_thresholds: Dict[str, int] = {
        "significantly_behind": 4,  # < 60%
        "behind": 3,                # 60-79%
        "on_track": 2,              # 80-99%
        "ahead": 1                  # >= 100%
    }
    subject_multiplier: float = 1.5  # Bonus for multi-subject students
    time_adjustment: Dict[str, float] = {
        "short": 0.7,   # 15-30 min sessions
        "normal": 1.0,  # 45-60 min sessions
        "long": 1.3     # 75-90 min sessions
    }
```

#### Student Preference Integration
```python
class StudentLearningPreferences(BaseModel):
    preferred_session_length: int  # minutes
    preferred_activity_count: Optional[int]
    subject_priorities: List[str]
    learning_style: str  # "visual", "auditory", "kinesthetic", "mixed"
    challenge_level: str  # "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"
```

### 2. Flexible Pedagogical Structure System

#### Adaptive Structure Templates
```python
PEDAGOGICAL_TEMPLATES = {
    "comprehensive": {
        "warm_up": 1,
        "core_challenge": 2,
        "practice_reinforcement": 2,
        "cool_down": 1
    },
    "focused": {
        "warm_up": 1,
        "core_challenge": 3,
        "practice_reinforcement": 1,
        "cool_down": 1
    },
    "review_heavy": {
        "warm_up": 1,
        "core_challenge": 1,
        "practice_reinforcement": 3,
        "cool_down": 1
    },
    "quick": {
        "warm_up": 1,
        "core_challenge": 2,
        "cool_down": 1
    }
}
```

#### Dynamic Structure Selection
```python
def select_pedagogical_template(student_profile: Dict, session_goals: List[str]) -> str:
    """Select optimal pedagogical template based on student needs"""
    if "review" in session_goals:
        return "review_heavy"
    elif student_profile.get("time_available", 60) < 30:
        return "quick"
    elif student_profile.get("mastery_level", "intermediate") == "advanced":
        return "focused"
    else:
        return "comprehensive"
```

### 3. Enhanced Daily Activities Integration

#### Improved API Endpoints
```python
@router.get("/daily-plan/{student_id}/adaptive")
async def get_adaptive_daily_plan(
    student_id: int,
    session_length: Optional[int] = Query(60, description="Session length in minutes"),
    learning_goals: Optional[str] = Query(None, description="Comma-separated goals"),
    user_context: dict = Depends(get_user_context)
):
    """Get adaptive daily plan based on student preferences and velocity"""
```

#### Configuration Management
```python
@router.post("/students/{student_id}/learning-preferences")
async def update_learning_preferences(
    student_id: int,
    preferences: StudentLearningPreferences,
    user_context: dict = Depends(get_user_context)

PUT  /api/students/{student_id}/learning-preferences

GET  /api/daily-plan/{student_id}/adaptive
POST /api/config/activity-allocation
GET  /api/config/activity-allocation
```

### Service Layer Changes
```python
class AdaptiveAIRecommendationService(AIRecommendationService):
    """Enhanced service with dynamic allocation"""

    def __init__(self, config_service, preference_service, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.config_service = config_service
        self.preference_service = preference_service

    async def generate_adaptive_playlist(
        self,
        student_id: int,
        session_length: int = 60,
        learning_goals: List[str] = None
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate playlist with dynamic allocation"""
        # Implementation details...
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```python
def test_velocity_based_allocation():
    """Test allocation logic with different velocity scenarios"""
    config = ActivityAllocationConfig()

    # Significantly behind student
    allocation = calculate_allocation(50, config)  # velocity_percentage
    assert allocation == 4

    # On track student
    allocation = calculate_allocation(90, config)
    assert allocation == 2

def test_pedagogical_template_selection():
    """Test template selection based on student profile"""
    profile = {"time_available": 25, "mastery_level": "beginner"}
    template = select_pedagogical_template(profile, [])
    assert template == "quick"
```

### Integration Tests
```python
def test_full_adaptive_playlist_generation():
    """Test complete playlist generation with preferences"""
    student_id = 123
    preferences = StudentLearningPreferences(
        preferred_session_length=45,
        learning_style="visual"
    )

    playlist = await adaptive_service.generate_adaptive_playlist(
        student_id, session_length=45
    )

    assert len(playlist['activities']) <= 4  # Adjusted for shorter session
    assert playlist['session_plan']['estimated_time_minutes'] <= 50
```
